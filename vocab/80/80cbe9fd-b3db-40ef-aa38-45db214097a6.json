  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>work</kanji>, and the verb version means <vocabulary>to work</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to labor</vocabulary>, and sometimes <vocabulary>to commit</vocabulary> (a crime).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: If you are as mad as a <reading>hatter</reading> you'll need <vocabulary>to work</vocabulary> very hard to regain your sanity. You know The Hatter from Alice in Wonderland? Imagine how hard he would have to work to be considered \"normal\".",
