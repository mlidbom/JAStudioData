  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nWhat are you trying <vocabulary>to dangle</vocabulary>? You're dangling a <reading>ta</reading>co (<ja>た</ja>) in front of a hungry person. He just wants the taco, and you keep dangling it like that.",
