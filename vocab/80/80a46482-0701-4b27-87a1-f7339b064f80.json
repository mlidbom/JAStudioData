  "sourceMnemonic": "<kanji>Silver</kanji> <kanji>apricot</kanji>s are called <vocabulary>ginkgo nut</vocabulary>s. Okay, they aren't really apricots, but they are silver and they sure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkgo_biloba#/media/File:Ginkgo_Seed.JPG\" target=\"_blank\">look the same</a>.\n\n",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This word is an exception. You'd think it would be the same in Japanese as it is in English, but it's not. And it has two different readings and meanings. Yikes, sorry. Here's a mnemonic to help you out:\n\nBefore you read this PLEASE PLEASE REMEMBER this is NOT a jukugo word. It's weird. You're gonna want to type <ja>ぎんこう</ja> but that's wrong. Stop that now.\n\nWhen you think of a <vocabulary>ginkgo tree</vocabulary> think about this: Ginkgos are a favorite nesting place for <reading>ea</reading>gles but evil Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> likes to eat eagles AND whole ginkgo trees. She prefers eating eagles WHILE THEY'RE IN THE GINKGO TREES AND ARE STILL ALIVE. So <ja>いちょう</ja>. Eagles and Mrs. Chou. And ginkgo trees. It's horrible to think about. Just like this reading not being jukugo.\n\nThe other meaning is the <vocabulary>ginkgo nut</vocabulary>s themselves. They taste like <ja><reading>銀</reading></ja> (<ja>ぎん</ja>) <reading>naan</reading> (<ja>なん</ja>). Mm mm soft and metallic, but still not the jukugo word though. How sad for you and all Japanese learners everywhere.",
