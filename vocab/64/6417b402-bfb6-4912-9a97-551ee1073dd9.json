  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is a little trickier. You start with two thousand (<ja>二千／にせん</ja>), then you need to add eleven to it (<ja>十一／じゅういち</ja>). Then, you simply add the reading for <ja>年</ja> which you already know. You can assume it's the on'yomi reading because it's attached to something else, like a jukugo. From there, you get the entire reading.",
