  "sourceMnemonic": "In your <kanji>knee</kanji> there is a <kanji>small</kanji> <kanji>priest</kanji> named <vocabulary>Kneecap</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a really common, cute way of talking about your kneecap. It's usually used by kids and adults alike, and it's more common in spoken Japanese than <ja>膝頭</ja>. Kind of like how we use \"kneecap\" instead of naming the \"patella\" bone all the time.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This word uses the kun'yomi readings for <ja>膝</ja> and <ja>小</ja>, but the on'yomi reading for <ja>僧</ja>, which gets rendaku'd from <ja>そう</ja> to <ja>ぞう</ja>, so watch out for that! You've learned all these reading before, so you should be able to read this as well. ",
