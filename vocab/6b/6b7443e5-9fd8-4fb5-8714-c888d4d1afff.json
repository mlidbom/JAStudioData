  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>thin</kanji> so the verb version is <vocabulary>to get thin</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf you want <vocabulary>to get thin</vocabulary>, just join the <reading>Ya</reading>nkees (<ja>や</ja>). They run their players around those four bases so much they all get thin quicker than you can throw a ball.",
