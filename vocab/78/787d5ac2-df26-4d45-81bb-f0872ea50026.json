It could be an arrow on a sign, or on piece of paper, or a document or whatever. We can just call it an <vocabulary>arrow</vocabulary>, or an <vocabulary>arrow symbol</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is <ja>矢</ja> and <ja>印</ja> put together into one. The <ja>印</ja> is like the actual vocab word <ja>印</ja>, but watch out for rendaku changing it from <ja>しるし</ja> to <ja>じるし</ja>.",
