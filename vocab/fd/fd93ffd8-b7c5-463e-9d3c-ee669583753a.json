  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>shock</kanji>. What happens when you're so old that your brain goes into shock? You start <vocabulary>to grow senile</vocabulary>. It's sad, but lots of people can't handle being old and they get like this.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nWhen you start <vocabulary>to grow senile</vocabulary> you'll make a new friend. It's <reading>Bo</reading>bo (<ja>ぼ</ja>) the clown! No one else can see him though, but that's okay! He'll become your very best friend. And he won't leave until you finally kick the bucket.",
