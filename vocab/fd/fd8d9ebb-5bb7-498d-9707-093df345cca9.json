  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "When a vocab word is a single kanji with no okurigana, it takes the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn this one yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember: \n\nWhen the <vocabulary>go-between</vocabulary> gets back and is about to tell you everything the other group said, it takes him <reading>two ta</reading>kes (<ja>つて</ja>) to get it all right. The other group had a lot to say and he had trouble getting it all on the first take, but he totally nailed it on the second.\n\nLittle side note: this word is actually more common in katakana, as in <ja>ツテ</ja>, or hiragana, as in <ja>つて</ja>. Still, you might see it in kanji too, and it's good if you can read it!",
