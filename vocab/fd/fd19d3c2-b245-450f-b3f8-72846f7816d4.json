This is a native Japanese word, and the kanji were assigned to it based on the meaning alone. That means you just have to memorize the reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWhen you see that someone's <vocabulary>good at</vocabulary> something, you say, \"<reading>Ooh</reading>, <reading>my</reading> (うまい)!\" at the top of your lungs. Try it! Think of something that impresses you and say \"ooh my!\" out loud.",
