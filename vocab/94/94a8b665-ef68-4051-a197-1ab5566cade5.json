  "sourceMnemonic": "In Japanese, <ja>さ</ja> on the end of a word is often the equivalent of \"-ness\" in English. In other words, if you replace the <ja>い</ja> on the end of an <ja>い</ja>-adjective with <ja>さ</ja>, you have a noun. In this case, the adjective is <ja>大きい</ja> (big) and the noun <ja>大きさ</ja> means \"bigness\", aka <vocabulary>size</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "When a vocab has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it is probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. Since you learned the on'yomi reading with the kanji <ja>大</ja>, we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember this word.\n\nWhen you saw the size of (pick something surprising), you said \"<ja><reading>おお</reading></ja> *#$@!\" Really imagine something surprising. Say the <ja>おお</ja> part out loud, as well. Think about the size of whatever you're looking at, too, and how big it is.",
