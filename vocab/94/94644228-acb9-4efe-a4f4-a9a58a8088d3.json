That means they share meanings as well.\n\nThis word also has a few more meanings: <vocabulary>instep</vocabulary> (the top part of the arch in your foot) and the <vocabulary>back of the hand</vocabulary>. These are parts of you that kinda look like turtle shells in shape, don't you think?",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This word is made up of a single kanji, but it uses the on'yomi reading, not the kun'yomi reading. Luckily, you've learned this reading already. Yay!",
