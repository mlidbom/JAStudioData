  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You are starting <vocabulary>to become</vocabulary> something else. You're transforming, but you're not sure what it is. First, you get fins... uh oh, something in the water. Then, you gain a tail and rubbery skin... hmm, something sea mammal-like. Oh, and then a huge horn flies out of your nose. You are going to become a <vocabulary>na</vocabulary>rwhal (<ja>な</ja>).",
