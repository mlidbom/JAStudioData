It's <vocabulary>heart shaped</vocabulary>. \n\nYou can add this kanji to all sorts of other things too to say \"____ shaped.\" Give it a try!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading for the kanji portion uses the kun'yomi reading. This is kind of like the reading you already learned for <ja>形</ja> just without the <ja>ち</ja> part. And rendaku happens too, so it becomes <ja>がた</ja>. If you can remember that, you should be able to remember this reading too!",
