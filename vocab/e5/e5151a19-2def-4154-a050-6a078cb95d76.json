  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an <ja>い</ja> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>near</kanji>? It's <vocabulary>close</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>nearby</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have to remember the <ja>ちか</ja> portion to be able to read this word. Imagine someone <vocabulary>close</vocabulary> to you... Too close. They are so close to you that they're touching their <reading>cheek</reading> (<ja>ちか</ja>) to your cheek. Feel the cheek on yours, it's getting awkward.",
