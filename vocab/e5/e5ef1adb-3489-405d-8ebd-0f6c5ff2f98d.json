  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nYou already learned <ja>煮る</ja>, which is used for when you purposefully boil something. This verb, on the other hand, is intransitive, meaning that it refers to when something is getting boiled or cooked up, with no emphasis on who put the thing in the pot. That's why this verb means <vocabulary>to be boiled</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be cooked</vocabulary>. ",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with the kanji. Good for you!",
