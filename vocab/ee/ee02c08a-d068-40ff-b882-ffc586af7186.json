  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou need <vocabulary>to hear</vocabulary> something very important, but you can't. In order to hear, you have to take a <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>) and unlock the doors covering your ears. Go ahead and imagine yourself doing that, focusing on the key.",
