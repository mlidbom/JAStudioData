You'll sometimes see this on the ends of \"incident\" names, like the \"Manshuu Jihen\" (<ja>満州事変</ja>), aka the \"Manshuu Incident.\" You know that it isn't an unusual or strange incident (like <ja>変事</ja>) because the \"strange\" kanji (<ja>変</ja>) doesn't come first with this word. Instead, it comes after and means \"change\" in this case.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
