The kanji <ja>苦</ja> means <kanji>suffering</kanji>, so what could a related adjective be? This word means <vocabulary>painful</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>agonizing</vocabulary>. ",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nEverything is really <vocabulary>painful</vocabulary> right now. Why? You have something heavy on top of you, <reading>cru</reading>shing (<ja>くる</ja>) you.",
