Additionally on top of <vocabulary>thing</vocabulary> there are the meanings <vocabulary>matter</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>action</vocabulary> as well. Like the kanji, this word has to do with action things... things that you do, for example, rather than physical things.",

Why did you do it? You knew that feisty wolverine was going to eat your <reading>coat</reading> (<ja>こと</ja>).",
