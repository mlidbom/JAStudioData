  "sourceMnemonic": "You've seen that <ja>召す</ja> can mean \"to respectfully eat,\" so adding <ja>上がる</ja>, \"to rise,\" means you're lifting the other person up. In polite language you use this when you're talking to someone higher up than you so you have to raise the humbly eating up. So it still means <vocabulary>to respectfully eat</vocabulary>, but raising it makes it a higher politeness level.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a combination of the words <ja>召す</ja> and <ja>上がる</ja> that you learned already. <ja>召す</ja> becomes <ja>召し</ja> and then you add that to <ja>上がる</ja>. Pretty straightforward, right?",
