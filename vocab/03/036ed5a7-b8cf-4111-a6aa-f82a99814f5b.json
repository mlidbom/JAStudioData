  "sourceMnemonic": "You can guess this is an adjective by looking at the <ja>い</ja> it ends with. One of the meanings of the kanji, <kanji>enchanting</kanji>, is already an adjective. That's the meaning of this word, too: <vocabulary>enchanting</vocabulary>. What is enchanting? It's basically <vocabulary>charming</vocabulary> in a <vocabulary>mysterious</vocabulary> way.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "So this <vocabulary>enchanting</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>charming</vocabulary> feeling is <vocabulary>mysterious</vocabulary>... some would say <ja>怪しい</ja> (suspicious). It actually shares the same reading as <ja>怪しい</ja>. They're kind of similar, too. Here's the difference:\n\n<ja>怪しい</ja> usually has a negative feel to it whereas <ja>妖しい</ja> generally has a positive feel. <ja>妖しい</ja> also feels more mysterious or has a magical edge.",
