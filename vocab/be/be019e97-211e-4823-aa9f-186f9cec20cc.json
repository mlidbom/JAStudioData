So, use your knowledge of the vocab <ja>年</ja> to help yourself to remember the reading for this word. You'll need to remember that the reading for this word is strange to get it into that brain of yours. \n\nThat being said, the reading <ja><reading>まいねん</reading></ja> works as well. I don't like this one as much as <ja>まいとし</ja> but it's equally acceptable.",
