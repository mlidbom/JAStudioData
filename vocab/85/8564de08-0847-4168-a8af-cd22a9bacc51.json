  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This word is really two separate words put together to form one, so let's look at it in two parts:\n\nThe kanji <ja>入</ja> has <ja>り</ja> attached to it as okurigana (hiragana that comes after a kanji), so you can bet that <ja>入り</ja> will use a kun'yomi reading for the kanji. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nThe <vocabulary>entrance</vocabulary> you're going through is really <reading>eerie</reading> (<ja>いり</ja>). It has cobwebs and creepy figures carved into it, and it just gives you a really eerie feeling.\n\nSince <ja>入り</ja> uses the kun'yomi, you can guess that <ja>口</ja> will follow suit. You learned this reading with the vocabulary, but the <ja>く</ja> in <ja>くち</ja> changes to <ja>ぐ</ja> due to something called rendaku. Think of it as an eerie entrance into the <reading>Gucci</reading> (<ja>ぐち</ja>) store.",
