  "sourceMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n\nDon't confuse this with the word <ja>〜道</ja>, though. This one doesn't have a <ja>〜</ja> at the beginning, meaning it's not attached to other words. This word is just plain old road. It has its own meaning!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\nYou're walking down the road. On the <vocabulary>road</vocabulary>, you bump into your friend, <reading>Mitch</reading> (<ja>みち</ja>). Imagine saying hello, then continuing down the road. What's weird is you're both walking down a paved road with cars on it. Seems dangerous, but you and Mitch, you know what you're doing. \n\nIf you don't know anyone named Mitch, think of a famous Mitch or a Mitch you've made up.",
