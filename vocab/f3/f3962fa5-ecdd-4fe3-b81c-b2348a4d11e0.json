Note this uses the alternative <ja>と</ja> reading, not to be confused with <ja>とう</ja> (actually, very confusing, sorry!). Just imagine you cut your <reading>toe</reading> off with an ice pick while mountain climbing. You know it's a short <ja>と</ja> because your toe is now short. And <ja>さん</ja> becomes <ja>ざん</ja> thanks to our old friend rendaku.",
