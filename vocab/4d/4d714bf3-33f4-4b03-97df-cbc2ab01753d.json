You learned this reading for <ja>乗</ja> with the word <ja>乗馬</ja>, but since that was quite a few levels ago, here's a mnemonic just in case:\n\nYou know one person who always has a hard time <vocabulary>boarding</vocabulary> a plane, and it's <reading>Jou</reading>rm (<ja>じょう</ja>), the farmhand. Jourm is what you'd call a very big boy. He doesn't fit in the tube thing you normally walk through when boarding a plane, so he has to climb up the side. It's a whole thing.",
