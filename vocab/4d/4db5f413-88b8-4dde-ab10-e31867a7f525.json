It means <vocabulary>to make a mistake</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to confuse</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to mistake</vocabulary>.\n\nThis verb is transitive. That means that it takes a direct object. Bear in mind that this one is a bit tricky, though, because although it's transitive in Japanese, the English translation will sometimes be intransitive.",
