You've learned both of these readings before, so you should be able to read this on your own, but here's a reminder for <ja>墓</ja> just in case:\n\nWhen you're finally dead and buried in a <vocabulary>graveyard</vocabulary>, your one wish is for the New Zealand All Blacks to do the <reading>Haka</reading> (<ja>はか</ja>) over your grave. If you don't know what the haka is, look it up, it's pretty neat.",
