  "sourceMnemonic": "You know <ja>外人</ja> the word that means \"foreigner,\" but that word is a bit informal and can come off as rude. The nicer, more politically correct version of the word is the one above. An <kanji>outside</kanji> <kanji>country</kanji> <kanji>person</kanji>. To differentiate this from \"foreigner\" we're going to use the more polite English version of this word as well (just like in Japanese): <vocabulary>Foreign Person</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since <ja>人</ja> has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nRemember how to spot a <vocabulary>foreigner</vocabulary>? That's right, they'll be in <reading>jean</reading>s (<ja>じん</ja>)!",
