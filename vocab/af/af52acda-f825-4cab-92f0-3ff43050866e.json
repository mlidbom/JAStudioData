  "sourceMnemonic": "The kanji <ja>月</ja> means both month and moon (because moon cycles take about a month, presumably). So, what is the number two month? It's not January... it's not March... it's <vocabulary>February</vocabulary>!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. <ja>月</ja> has two on'yomi readings, but it always uses the <ja>がつ</ja> reading in the names of the months, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember that:\n\n<vocabulary>February</vocabulary> is the month when somebody gives you a <reading>knee</reading> in the <reading>guts</reading> (<ja>にがつ</ja>). A complete stranger comes around each February just to knee you right in the guts. Ouch! That's why February is your least favourite month.",
