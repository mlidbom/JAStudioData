  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>suit</kanji> so the verb version is <vocabulary>to suit</vocabulary>. \n\nThis word also means <vocabulary>to come together</vocabulary> as well. Presumably when something suits something else, it comes together with it flawlessly. That's why this word also has this other meaning (and it will be important for future vocab as well).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "You want to find a pet <vocabulary>to suit</vocabulary> your personal style, so you get matched with an <reading>a</reading>ardvark (<ja>あ</ja>). An aardvark will match the ant mounds you use for chairs and couches, it's the perfect match.",
