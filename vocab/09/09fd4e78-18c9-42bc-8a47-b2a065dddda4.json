  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an <ja>い</ja> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>heavy</kanji>? It's also <vocabulary>heavy</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou're lifting something that's really <vocabulary>heavy</vocabulary>. Oof! You lift it above your head. You're so awesome. You scream: \"<reading>OH! MO</reading>RE!\" (<ja>おも</ja>) they put more. You yell it again: \"OH, MORE!\" and again: \"OH, MORE!\" Go ahead and act this out wherever you are, pretending like you're holding a couch or two or three over your head, saying \"OH MORE!\"",
