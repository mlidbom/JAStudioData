  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>wide</kanji>, and the verb version is what happens when you try to make something wider. How do you make something wider? That's right, you have <vocabulary>to spread something</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to unfold something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to open something up</vocabulary>. All of those actions will make a thing wider!\n\nThis is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. You spread something. Like a newspaper, or a cloth on a table.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with the kanji, but here's a reminder mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou are going <vocabulary>to spread something</vocabulary>. What are you going to spread? How about your arms, so that you can fly into the sky like the super <reading>hero</reading> (<ja>ひろ</ja>) that you are! Most heroes can fly when they spread their arms wide!",
