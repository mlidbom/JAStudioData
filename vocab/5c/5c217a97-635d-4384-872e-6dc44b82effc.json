  "sourceMnemonic": "This word begins with an honorific (<ja>お</ja>), making whatever comes after it more elevated. Then there's <ja>父</ja>, which you know means <kanji>father</kanji>. Lastly, we have the honorific name ender <ja>さん</ja>. So this is a nice way to say <vocabulary>father</vocabulary>. You use it when you're talking to your own <vocabulary>dad</vocabulary> or talking about him with friends. You can also use this when you're talking about your friends' dads.\n\nIn more formal settings, you'll want to use <ja>父</ja> (pronounced <ja>ちち</ja>) to talk about your own dad and <ja>お父様</ja> to talk about someone else's dad. Don't worry, you'll learn that last kanji in a few lessons. Until then, it's pronounced, <ja>おとうさま</ja>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The part you have to learn to read is the <ja>父</ja> portion. This uses the kun'yomi, which you didn't learn when doing the kanji. \n\nImagine you are taking your venerable <vocabulary>father</vocabulary> to <reading>とう</reading>きょう. He's always wanted to go and this is the trip of a lifetime! Imagine walking through the streets of Tokyo with your Dad, taking in all the sights.",
