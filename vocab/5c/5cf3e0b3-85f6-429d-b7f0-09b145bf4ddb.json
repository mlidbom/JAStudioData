  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an&nbsp;<ja>う</ja>&nbsp;sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means&nbsp;<kanji>rub</kanji>&nbsp;and this verb means&nbsp;<vocabulary>to rub</vocabulary>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<vocabulary>to scrub</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "If you're going <vocabulary>to rub</vocabulary> me like that, I'm going to <reading>sue</reading> (<ja>す</ja>) you. It's making me very uncomfortable. The <reading>cos</reading>t  (<ja>こす</ja>) of your rubbing actions will be high.\n    \nSo this word has two readings and both mean “to rub.” But you usually use <ja>する</ja> for a single action, such as lighting a match or grazing your knee, while <ja>こする</ja> means doing it repeatedly, like when you’re cleaning or polishing something.",
