  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou go <vocabulary>to open</vocabulary> the door. When you do, a huge scream comes out: \"<reading>AAAHHH</reading>!\" (<ja>あ</ja>). Imagine giant <ja>あ</ja> characters flying out of the door you opened as well.",
