  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: What is it that you want? You want a <reading>moat</reading> (<ja>もと</ja>) around your home. Your neighbor's cats keep pooping on your lawn, but if you had a moat they wouldn't be able to get to your lawn in the first place, since cats hate water (and alligators). You request a moat!",
