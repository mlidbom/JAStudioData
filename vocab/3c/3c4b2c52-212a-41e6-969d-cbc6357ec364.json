This word here talks about <kanji>one</kanji> <kanji>individual</kanji>. A better way to translate that would be to call it <vocabulary>one small thing</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The <ja>いち</ja> gets shortened, but I bet you knew that already.",
