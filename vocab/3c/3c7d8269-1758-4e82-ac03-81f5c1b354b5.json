  "sourceMnemonic": "What makes it <kanji>bright</kanji> around here? It's the <vocabulary>light</vocabulary>!\n\nNow you might wonder: how is this different from 光 (ひかり)? 光 is more general, and often used specifically for sunlight. 明かり often refers to some specific source of light, like the kind that illuminates a room, so it's often used for light that comes from lamps.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Do you remember the adjective 明るい (あかるい), meaning \"bright\"? As you can see, these words are quite similar! You just need to remember that the か in 明かり isn't part of the kanji, like in 明るい.",
