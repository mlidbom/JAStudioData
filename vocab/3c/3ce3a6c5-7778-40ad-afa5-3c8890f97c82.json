  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is that of the word <ja>出る</ja> and the word <ja>会う</ja>, both of which you've hopefully seen. The <ja>出</ja> portion may be confusing, but you can usually assume that if one part of the word is kun'yomi / vocab reading, the other part is too, which is why <ja>出</ja> uses the vocab reading.\n\nOh by the way, this word can be written like this too: <ja>出合う</ja>. It’s not as common, but you may come across it every now and then, so it’s good to know! ",
