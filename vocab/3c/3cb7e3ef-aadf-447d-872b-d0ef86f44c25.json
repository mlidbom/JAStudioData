  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>come</kanji> so you know this word means <vocabulary>to come</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading for this word is pretty strange. It changes depending on the type of verb form you use (it's a pesky exception verb). To remember the reading of this word, here's a mnemonic: \n\n\"I want you <vocabulary>to come</vocabulary> to the <reading>coo</reading>l (<ja>く</ja>) side, Luke,\" says Darth Vader.\n\"What?\" replies Luke.\n\nJust replace this line into the famous line from Star Wars. Say it out loud. Do the Vader voice. It'll help you to remember.",
