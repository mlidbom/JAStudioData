  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is unlike what you learned with this kanji before. Just think about how you have this <vocabulary>stain</vocabulary> on your shirt, all because you were trying to dye some <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>) and they didn't like it. So now you have a big dye and sheep poo stain. How were you supposed to know sheep don't like being dyed?!",
