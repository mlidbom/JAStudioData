Well, the <ja>弁</ja> in this word comes from that, so pretend it means \"bento.\" Then, when you have a <kanji>train station</kanji> to go along with the bento, you have a <vocabulary>train station bento</vocabulary>. As you might think, a train station bento is just a bento that's sold at a train station. Easy!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
