  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>receive</kanji>, and this verbs means just about the same thing: <vocabulary>to receive something</vocabulary>!\n\nThis is a transitive verb, so it takes a direct object. You receive something, like an education.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "You want <vocabulary>to receive something</vocabulary> more than anything else in the world. It's a <reading>uke</reading>lele (<ja>うけ</ja>), of course. Then you can live your Hawaiian paradise fantasy... after you learn to play of course. By the way, you better say ukelele the correct way, like \"ooh kay lay lay,\" not the Anglicized way! ",
