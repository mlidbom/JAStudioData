  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Often times, when two kanji come together to form a kanji compound (or jukugo), you use the on'yomi readings. This is similar to that, though instead of another kanji it's a foreign word. This pattern works with almost any country as well. Just add <ja>人</ja> to a country name and you've described the people who live there. You'll see more of these before you're finished here.\n\nAnd since <ja>人</ja> has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use: \n\nAs with all words for nationalities, the <ja>人</ja> here is pronounced <ja>じん</ja>. Like people of all other nationalities, a <vocabulary>French person</vocabulary> loves their <reading>jean</reading>s (<ja>じん</ja>) too!",
