Imagine a famous Takuya, like actor and singer Kimura Takuya (<ja>木村 拓哉</ja> a.k.a. <ja>キムタク</ja>), or a Takuya you know, cultivating a huge field of question marks. Rows and rows of question marks. I wonder what he's going to do with all those question marks once they're ready to harvest. Other people who must have an abundance of question marks are pro baseball player Kinoshita Takuya (<ja>木下 拓哉</ja> a.k.a. <ja>キノタク</ja>) and actor, model, and K-Pop star Terada Takuya (<ja>寺田 拓哉</ja>).",
