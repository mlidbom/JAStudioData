  "sourceMnemonic": "You know that <ja>向</ja> means <kanji>yonder</kanji>. So, think of a \"yonder <ja>こういち</ja>.\" All you know is that he's <vocabulary>over there</vocabulary> on the <vocabulary>other side</vocabulary> / <vocabulary>opposite side</vocabulary> of where you are. Basically, he's just pretty <vocabulary>far away</vocabulary>, wherever he is.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nStanding with <ja>こういち</ja> is a cow. It is saying <reading>moo</reading> (<ja>む</ja>). Weird, now <ja>こういち</ja> is saying it too. Also, if you know the reading of <ja>向く</ja> you should be able to read this one as well.",
