Handing them out takes way too much time, so if you just <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfaNkGXrEtA\" target=\"_blank\">scatter them all over the place</a> your job will be done so much faster!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned the <ja>散る</ja>, so you should be able to read it already! \n\nNote that this word is almost always written in kana, and チラシ is much more common than ちらし. ",
