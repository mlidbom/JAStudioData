  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>swell</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to swell</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to expand</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nSomeone comes up to you and asks, \"Hey, do you want your stomach to swell like that?\" How dare they ask you about your stomach. You respond with, \"<reading>F@#$</reading> (<ja>ふく</ja>) you!\" It's none of their business how much you want your stomach to expand.",
