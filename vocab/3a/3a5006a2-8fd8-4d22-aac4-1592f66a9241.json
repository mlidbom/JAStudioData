  "sourceMnemonic": "You saw <ja>締める</ja>, which means \"to tighten.\" So when things tighten, and then they get <kanji>cut</kanji> off, it's when you've reached the <vocabulary>deadline</vocabulary>. You know that feeling? When you get close, you feel a tightening in your stomach. The deadline is near! But, then when your tightening gets cut off completely, it's because you've reached the end. The <vocabulary>deadline</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is <ja>締める</ja> and <ja>切る</ja> put together. Notice how the hiragana bits get pushed into the kanji though, that's the interesting part, but also the part that's hard to remember. It's probably because this is a short version of <ja>締め切り</ja>, but you'll see <ja>締切</ja> more often.",
