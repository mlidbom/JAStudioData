  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>grieve</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to grieve</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be anxious</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYour aunt starts <vocabulary>to grieve</vocabulary> really loudly at your Uncle Ray's funeral. \"<reading>Ooh, Ray</reading> (<ja>うれ</ja>)! OOoh, Ray why did you have to leave me!\" It's really sad. You even hear it in your head after you've left and gone home. You've never seen someone start <vocabulary>to be distressed</vocabulary> like that in public.",
