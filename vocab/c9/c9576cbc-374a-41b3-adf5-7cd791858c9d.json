The kanji itself means <kanji>immersed</kanji>, so the verb version is what happens when you immerse something in a liquid. It's <vocabulary>to soak</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to dip</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You already learned this reading when you learned <ja>浸る</ja>, so you should know this one too.",
