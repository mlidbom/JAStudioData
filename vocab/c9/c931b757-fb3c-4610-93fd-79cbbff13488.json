  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: Okay, this is a great <vocabulary>value</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>price</vocabulary>. Wait, what is? <reading>A tie</reading> (<ja>あたい</ja>). Get a tie, and it will make you more professional which will help you to get a better job. Great value, right there, just for a tie.",
