  "sourceMnemonic": "This is an intransitive version of <ja>擦る</ja>, so it means <vocabulary>to be rubbed</vocabulary>. It often implies damage, in which case it can mean <vocabulary>to be grazed</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be scraped</vocabulary>, like when your knee gets grazed against a rough wall. ",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "You really don’t want your knee <vocabulary>to be grazed</vocabulary>. If it happens, you are gonna <reading>sue</reading> (<ja>す</ja>). But the <reading>cos</reading>t (<ja>こす</ja>) of suing is pretty high, so be careful not to get grazed in the first place!\n\nDepending on which reading you use, the nuance changes slightly. For example, <ja>すれる</ja> is the usual choice when you’re talking about your grazed knees or worn out jeans. For other uses, they are often interchangeable.",
