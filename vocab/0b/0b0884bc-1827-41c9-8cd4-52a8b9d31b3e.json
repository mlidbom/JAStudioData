  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. The <ja>物</ja> takes its <ja>もつ</ja> reading, which makes sense since it sounds like <ja>持つ</ja>, which is \"to hold.\" What is this freighter doing? It's holding freight! So, that's how you can remember that bit.",
