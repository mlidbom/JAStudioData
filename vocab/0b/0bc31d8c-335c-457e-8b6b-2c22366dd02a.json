  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>replace</kanji>, and this word means <vocabulary>to be replaced</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to be substituted</vocabulary>, and <vocabulary>to be switched</vocabulary>.\n\nThis verb is intransitive, meaning it doesn't take a direct object. You'll sometimes see it with the particle <ja>を</ja>, though, because the <ja>を</ja> is showing a \"path\" rather than a direct object in this case.",
