  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This word uses the kun'yomi readings for the kanji. You kind of learned this reading for <ja>憂</ja>, but not exactly. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember it: \n\nThe <vocabulary>bitterness</vocabulary> that shows in your eyes takes the <reading>ray</reading>s (<ja>れ</ja>) of light out of them, leaving you with just the <ja>う</ja> part of the reading that you know. That's why this reading is just <ja>う</ja> and not <ja>うれ</ja> like the others.",
