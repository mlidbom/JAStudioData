  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>need</kanji> and the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to need</vocabulary>.\n\nThis one's a little tricky, because although it's usually translated as \"to need\" in English, it's used more like <vocabulary>to be needed</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be necessary</vocabulary>. That is, it's an intransitive verb in Japanese, so it doesn't take a direct object.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since the reading isn't like the one you learned, think about what you are going <vocabulary>to need</vocabulary>... like, what you're really going to need, more than anything. Then, think of an <reading>ea</reading>gle, because you really need an eagle. You'll need to come up with the reason why you need an eagle though, so hopefully it's a good one.",
