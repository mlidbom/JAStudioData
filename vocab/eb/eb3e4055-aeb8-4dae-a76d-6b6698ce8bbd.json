  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>stuffed</kanji>, this word means <vocabulary>to stuff in</vocabulary>, as in you're doing the stuffing. You know that this is the case because when it comes to the <reading>mail</reading> (<ja>める</ja>), you stuff that mail into the garbage as hard as you can (it's all junk).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned that reading with the kanji, so you should have no troubles here.",
