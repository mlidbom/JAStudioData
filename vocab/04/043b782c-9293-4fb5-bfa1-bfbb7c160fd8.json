  "sourceMnemonic": "You don't say \"to aggression.\" When you do aggression on someone, you're probably doing something to hurt them in some way. This is an attack, making this word <vocabulary>to attack</vocabulary>. This refers to a planned attack, though. Think about what you're going to do. Plan it out. Then, <ja>攻める</ja>!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou're planning <vocabulary>to attack</vocabulary> right now, so <reading>say</reading> (<ja>せ</ja>) it out loud. \"ATTAAAACK!\" There, you said it. Imagine who or what you're saying it to, then imagine yourself carrying out your carefully planned attack.",
