  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>distribute</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to distribute</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have <vocabulary>to distribute</vocabulary> some fliers to everyone. On the fliers it talks about a striptease show where <reading>kubla</reading>i (<ja>くば</ja>) Khan does something naughty. Imagine this show, and imagine your shame of being the person handing out these fliers. How far the Khan has fallen.",
