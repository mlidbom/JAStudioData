  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember: \n\n<vocabulary>Leather</vocabulary> is the skin of a cow, right? How do you say \"skin\" in Japanese? Remember <ja>皮</ja> aka <ja><reading>かわ</reading></ja>? It has the same reading as that, and they're both skin, so hopefully that makes it easier to remember.",
