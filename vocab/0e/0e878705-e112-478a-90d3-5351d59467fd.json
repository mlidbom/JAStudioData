  "sourceMnemonic": "The meaning of this word is pretty strange, having very little to do with the kanji meaning you learned. This word means <vocabulary>to carry something out</vocabulary>. Maybe you can think of it like someone is saying \"You (<ja>う</ja>) <kanji>go</kanji> do that task!\" to get yourself <vocabulary>to carry out</vocabulary> the task. Whatever you do, just know this is a weird exception word, so you may have to do some extra work to remember it.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is also a strange exception. You have to remember the <ja>おこな</ja> portion. Maybe this mnemonic will help: You have <vocabulary>to carry out</vocabulary> a task but you're not too excited about it. Then you find out the task will bring you to Kona, Hawaii. \"<reading>Oh, Kona!?</reading>\" (<ja>おこな</ja>), you shout. In that case, you'll get right on it.",
