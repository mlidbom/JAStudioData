  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nImagine something rolling down a hill. Inside is a very important uranium <reading>core</reading> (<ja>ころ</ja>) that you need to keep spinning. That's why they have it rolling down hill after hill, because they don't have anything else to keep it spinning like that, preventing it from exploding. This core is very important!\n\nIf you have trouble remembering the hiragana ending, just imagine a <reading>girl</reading> (<ja>がる</ja>) rolling down the hill too.",
