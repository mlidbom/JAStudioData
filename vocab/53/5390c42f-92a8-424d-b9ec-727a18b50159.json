  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This reading is a little messy. This reading for <ja>愛</ja> is an exception, <ja>媛</ja> uses the kun'yomi reading <ja>ひめ</ja>, and <ja>県</ja> uses the on'yomi reading <ja>けん</ja>. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember this reading for <ja>愛</ja>:\n\nIf you ask anyone outside of <vocabulary>Ehime Prefecture</vocabulary> what they think of princesses they'll respond with, \"<reading>Eh</reading>\" (<ja>え</ja>). They don't really care either way. If someone from Ehime heard that they'd says, \"EH? EH?! Princesses are the BEST!\"",
