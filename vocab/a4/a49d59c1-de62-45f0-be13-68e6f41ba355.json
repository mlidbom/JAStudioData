  "sourceMnemonic": "The <ja>お</ja> is an honorific that makes this word a bit more fancy. When you're talking about money you gotta be fancy, after all. So, you're basically saying \"gold\" in a nicer way. What was gold back in the day? It was <vocabulary>money</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading for <ja>金</ja> is different from the one you learned with the kanji. Makes sense since this is a single kanji with hiragana attached. Here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou've saved up a ton of money. With it you're going to buy something awesome. Then, suddenly someone hits you in the knees with a bat. Now you have to spend all your <vocabulary>money</vocabulary> buying a <reading>cane</reading> (<ja>かね</ja>). Sucks for you :(",
