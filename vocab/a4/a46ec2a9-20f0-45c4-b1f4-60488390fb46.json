  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>beckon</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to beckon</vocabulary>. It can also mean <vocabulary>to invite</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to summon</vocabulary> as well.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You move <vocabulary>to beckon</vocabulary> your friend over. You can't see him well, so that's why you invite him to come closer. He is hiding something, and it turns out to be his long, luxurious horse <reading>mane</reading> (<ja>まね</ja>). Why does he have a mane!? Horse steroids?",
