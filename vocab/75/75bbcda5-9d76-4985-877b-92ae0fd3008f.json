  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nThe kanji <ja>点</ja> means <kanji>point</kanji>, but this verb actually means <vocabulary>to be lit</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be ignited</vocabulary>. Think of it this way, when a flashlight turns on, it points a beam, of light.\n\nYou already learned <ja>点ける</ja>, which is for when you turn something on. <ja>点く</ja>, on the other hand, is an intransitive verb. That means it happens by itself. Like, \"Oh look! The lights came on! That's cool (<ja>く</ja>)!\"",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "You already learned this reading when you learned <ja>点ける</ja> but here's a mnemonic just in case:\n\nEvery time you count to <reading>two</reading> (<ja>つ</ja>) a light comes on. How <reading>cool</reading> (<ja>く</ja>) that it does it all by itself!!\n\n",
