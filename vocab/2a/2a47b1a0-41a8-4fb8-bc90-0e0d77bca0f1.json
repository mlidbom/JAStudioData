  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>solve</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to be solved</vocabulary>. You know that this is the version where something just unties on its own (you're not doing the untying) because you don't have a <reading>care</reading> (<ja>ける</ja>) in the world. You just watch things getting untied and don't do it yourself.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: In fact, while you're sitting there with no cares, waiting for things to become untied, you stare down at your <reading>toe</reading> (<ja>と</ja>). Really imagine doing that while things around you are getting untied.",
