  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>arrange</kanji>, and the verb version also means <vocabulary>to arrange</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to put in order</vocabulary>. This has to do with putting things in their rightful place, getting affairs in order, or even preparing equipment.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nEverything in your room has finally been <vocabulary>put in order</vocabulary>. Just as you finish, you hear a crash and turn to see your dog has jumped up onto your desk. \"<reading>Toto no</reading> (<ja>ととの</ja>)!\" you yell as he knocks everything over. Guess you have  <vocabulary>to arrange</vocabulary>  it all over again. Dammit Toto.",
