  "sourceMnemonic": "You know that <ja>助ける</ja> means \"to help\" and this is related. This is when someone is being helped, and we're focussing on the person being helped, rather than the person doing the helping. In grammatical terms, this verb is intransitive, so there is no object. The <ja>かる</ja> ending is a hint, because verbs with <ja>かる</ja> as okurigana (kana added to the kanji) are usually intransitive.\n\nIt also can be used to talk about how you were rescued, which is like being helped, right? If you want to memorize it that way, that's fine too.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as <ja>助ける</ja>, so hopefully you know that word and can apply that knowledge over here.",
