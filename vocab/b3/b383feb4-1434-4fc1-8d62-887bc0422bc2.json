  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nThis is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. The kanji itself means <kanji>approach</kanji>, and the verb version is about making or letting something approach. That's why it means <vocabulary>to move something close to</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to pull something over</vocabulary>, and also <vocabulary>to contribute something</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "You want <vocabulary>to move something close to</vocabulary> you, but it's out of reach. The solution, of course, is to take out your trusty <reading>yo</reading>-yo (<ja>よ</ja>) and lasso that thing and pull it closer! ",
