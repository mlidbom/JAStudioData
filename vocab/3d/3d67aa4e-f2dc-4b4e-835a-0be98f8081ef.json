As you can probably guess, this last use has a poetic feel to it.\n\nLike many verbs ending in <ja>す</ja>, this verb is transitive, meaning it's being done to something. So you can use it when you cure an illness, heal a broken heart, or quench your thirst for adventure!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "<vocabulary>To heal something</vocabulary> it's sometimes necessary to do something <reading><ja>いや</ja></reading> (gross). Even if you dislike it, even if it's gross, you do it anyway, because you want to heal whatever it is.",
