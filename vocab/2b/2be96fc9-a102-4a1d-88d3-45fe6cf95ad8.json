  "sourceMnemonic": "This one's a little weird. You have a <kanji>group</kanji> of <kanji>cloth</kanji>. Think about this. If you group together a bunch of cloth into one big cloth, you have something nice and soft. What can you use this nice and soft cloth things for? Well, you can sleep on it. This is the Japanese word <vocabulary>futon</vocabulary>, which you may have heard in English before (though the Japanese futon is quite different from the American one). You can also translate this to <vocabulary>bedding</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>sleeping mat</vocabulary> too.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The reading for <ja>団</ja> is the secondary reading that went with the kanji, though, so watch out for that. If you can figure out the meaning of this word, chances are you already know how to spell it, so carry that over to Japanese.",
