To say that in words, you might say <vocabulary>therefore</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>consequently</vocabulary>. You stated your case and ideas, then in order to go towards reason we use these words to transition towards it.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "By knowing the word <ja>故</ja> you'll know the reading for this word too! Here's a mnemonic in case you need a reminder, though:\n\nYou're using WaniKani, <vocabulary>therefore</vocabulary> you're studying kanji and vocab. Whose fault is it? It's WaniKani's fault! But, your brain has been beaten to a mush from all the studying, so when you say \"it's your fault\" it comes out as \"it's <reading>yue</reading> fault!\" Go ahead and say it out loud that way.",
