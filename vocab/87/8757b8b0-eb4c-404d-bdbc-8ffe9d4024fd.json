The reading for <ja>速</ja> (<ja>そく</ja>) is what you'd expect (on'yomi), but <ja>早</ja> gets a reading you haven't seen before, meaning you should treat this as an exception. Just think about how you're learning this word <vocabulary>at once</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>without delay</vocabulary> so there's no time for any <reading>sa</reading>ss (<ja>さっ</ja>), just kanji learning.",
