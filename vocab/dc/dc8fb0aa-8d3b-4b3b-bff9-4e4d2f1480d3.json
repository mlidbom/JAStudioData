The kanji itself means <kanji>reflect</kanji>. The verb vocab version means <vocabulary>to be reflected</vocabulary>. You're not doing the reflecting directly. You can remember this by thinking how rude (<ja>る</ja>) it is that someone's reflecting your image using a mirror for everyone outside the dressing room to see.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYour reflection is getting reflected onto the mirror. You don't like it, it doesn't look like you. Impostor reflection! You take a hammer and you <ja><reading>打つ</reading></ja> (<ja>うつ</ja>) it as hard as you can, glass flying everywhere. Then some dubstep starts playing from the broken mirror: <ja>うつうつうつうつ</ja>. ",
