  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>deposit</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to deposit</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to entrust</vocabulary>. You use this word when you are leaving something with someone else. ",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nIn terms of places where you want <vocabulary>to deposit</vocabulary> your money, the last place on your list should be <reading>a zoo</reading> (<ja>あず</ja>). I mean seriously, you know the animals are just gonna munch up all your dolla bills. ",
