  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>multiply</kanji> and the verb vocab version means <vocabulary>to multiply</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to increase</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "What is multiplying? Your use of the word \"<reading>fu</reading>\" (<ja>ふ</ja>) for when you laugh. You used to say just \"ha ha ha\" like everyone else. Now the occurrences of you saying <reading>fufufu</reading> is really multiplying. You might also notice that this is similar to the word <ja>増える</ja>, which means \"to increase.\" This has a similar meaning and the same reading, use that to your advantage!",
