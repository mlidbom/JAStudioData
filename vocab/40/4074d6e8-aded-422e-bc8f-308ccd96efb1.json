A really important one. If you didn't have that neck, you wouldn't look like a person at all. Sound familiar? It should! Because that part of your neck is a <vocabulary>radical</vocabulary>! Just like part of your neck is a building block of your body, the radical is a building block of kanji. Get it? I sure hope so!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <ja>首</ja> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWhen you need a <vocabulary>radical</vocabulary> to make a new kanji, you just press a button and the radical comes tumbling down the radical <reading>chu</reading>te (<ja>しゅ</ja>). There's definitely no rhyme or reason to radical picking, it's just whatever pops out of the ol' chute.\n ",
