  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This word's reading is pretty weird. We're going to think back to a couple different words to put this one together. The word for heart (<ja>心</ja>), is <ja>こころ</ja>. The word for good is <ja>よい</ja> (or <ja>いい</ja>, but for this word's sake, <ja>よい</ja>). A \"good heart (feeling)\" is one where your heart feels nice and warm and fuzzy (figuratively, not literally. If it's literal, go to the hospital please). That is a <vocabulary>pleasant</vocabulary> feeling. A <ja>こころよい</ja> feeling.",
