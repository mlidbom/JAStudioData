If you want to be fancier about it, you could say this is <vocabulary>composition</vocabulary>.\n\nNote that <ja>作文</ja> often refers to the end result of a writing process, like a finished essay, rather than the writing process itself. It’s also commonly associated with various writing tasks assigned to students in Japanese elementary or middle school.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since both <ja>文</ja> and <ja>作</ja> have two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which ones to use:\n\nYou can't stop writing <vocabulary>composition</vocabulary>s about <reading>sack</reading>s 'n' <reading>bun</reading>s (<ja>さくぶん</ja>). You're obsessed with them. You've been writing <vocabulary>essay</vocabulary> after essay about sacks 'n' buns. Stop <vocabulary>writing</vocabulary> about sacks 'n' buns!",
