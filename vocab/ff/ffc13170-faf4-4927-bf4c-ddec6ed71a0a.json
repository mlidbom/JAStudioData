  "sourceMnemonic": "This is just the noun version of the kanji <ja>酒</ja> - it has an <ja>お</ja> there to be nice. This word can mean both <vocabulary>alcohol</vocabulary> (like the parent kanji) or <vocabulary>sake</vocabulary> (the main kind of Japanese alcohol, at least back in the kanji days).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is kun'yomi, which isn't what you learned with the kanji. But, it should be pretty easy. You know what Japanese alcohol is called already, right? It's <ja><reading>さけ</reading></ja>, simple as that. So long as you've heard of sake you should be A-Okay with this reading.",
