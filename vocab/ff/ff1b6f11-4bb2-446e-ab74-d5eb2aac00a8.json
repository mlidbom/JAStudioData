  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>remainder</kanji>, but you can't really \"to remainder.\" What is something that's similar that would make sense? How about <vocabulary>to leave behind</vocabulary>. This is when you're actually doing the leaving behind too. For example, you eat some food and you leave behind your rice because you're a bad child. You can remember this because of <ja>す</ja>. Every time you leave some food behind your mom would <reading>sue</reading> you, because she was a terrible mom. Imagine this.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading for this word can come from level 14 item <ja>残る</ja>. Associate the two in your mind and you'll be able to read both.",
