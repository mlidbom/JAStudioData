Well, if that's the case, then you have an emergency doorway. Usually you run away from emergencies, though, making this an <vocabulary>emergency exit</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the words <ja>非常</ja> and <ja>口</ja> combined together. The thing that makes this weird is that it's a mix of the kun and on'yomi readings. I guess things get all jostled up when you have yourself an emergency.",
