  "sourceMnemonic": "If you <kanji>consume</kanji> <kanji>tea</kanji> in a <kanji>shop</kanji>, it could either be a <vocabulary>cafe</vocabulary>, a <vocabulary>tea house</vocabulary>, or slightly confusingly, a <vocabulary>coffee shop</vocabulary>. Welcome! Sit down. Relax. Have some tea (or coffee).\n\nThis word often refers to cafes with a retro feel to them, though they can be modern too. These places usually serve a variety of drinks and light meals.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The readings are what you'd expect except for <ja>きつ</ja> getting shortened to <ja>きっ</ja> and <ja>茶</ja>, which has this strange <ja>さ</ja> reading. To remember that it's <ja>さ</ja> instead of <ja>ちゃ</ja>, think of this <vocabulary>tea house</vocabulary> you're going in. You think it's nice and pleasant, and it is for a while... until someone starts working a <reading>saw</reading> (<ja>さ</ja>) outside, ruining the atmosphere.
