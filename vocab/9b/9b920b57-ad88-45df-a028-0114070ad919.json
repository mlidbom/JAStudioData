  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "To learn the reading, just think about how you're looking at something for a lonnnnng time if you're staring at it. In Japanese the word \"long\" is <ja>長い</ja>, and guess what the reading of the kanji part is? It's <ja><reading>なが</reading></ja>, just like <ja>ながめる</ja>'s kanji-part reading.",
