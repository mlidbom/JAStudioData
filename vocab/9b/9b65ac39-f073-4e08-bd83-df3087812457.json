  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>fat</kanji> so the verb form of that is <vocabulary>to get fat</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You have to learn the <ja>ふと</ja> portion of this word to be able to read it. Here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou're getting fat so quickly that you can see your body expanding. You look down - at first you can see your <reading>foot</reading> (<ja>ふと</ja>) but then a second later you can't. You can't see your foot because you're getting fat, even when you stick your foot way out. What's going on?",
