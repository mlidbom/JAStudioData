The kanji itself means <kanji>char</kanji>, but the verb version is <vocabulary>to be burned</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to get burned</vocabulary>. You're not doing the burning, of course, but you're getting burned (owch!).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The times where you were burned were mostly when you were a kid (<ja><reading>子</reading></ja>). That's because kids aren't good at working with hot things.",
