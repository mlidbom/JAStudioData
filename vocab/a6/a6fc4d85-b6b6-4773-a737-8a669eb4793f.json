There are <reading>me</reading>at <reading>gee</reading>se (<ja>みぎ</ja>) over there. What are meat geese, you ask? They're geese made of meat, that sit to the right of you, trying to get you to do bad things. Like the devil/angel motif you see in cartoons. Well there's nothing on your left. And on your right? Just meat geese. Watching you. Waiting. Geese made of meat. Telling you not to do the right thing.",
