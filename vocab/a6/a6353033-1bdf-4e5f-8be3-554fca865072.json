  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou're the kind of person who likes <vocabulary>to take</vocabulary> things. \"What things?\" you ask. Little <reading>toe</reading>s (<ja>と</ja>). Because that isn't creepy.",
