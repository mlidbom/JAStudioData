  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> (in this case <ja>る</ja>) sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>separate</kanji> (at least, that's one of its several meanings). So, the verb form of that is <vocabulary>to separate something</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to divide something</vocabulary>,  <vocabulary>to share something</vocabulary> or  <vocabulary>to split something</vocabulary>. \n\nYou'll have to differentiate this word with <ja>分かる</ja> which is very similar but has a totally different meaning. You'll need to learn the reading to do this, but think of it this way: You must \"separate\" your Wake (<ja>わけ</ja>) time from your sleeping time.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou are <vocabulary>to separate</vocabulary> a couple of children that really have fun together. When you separate them, they begin to cry and scream: <reading>WAAAAAAAAAHHHH</reading> (<ja>わ</ja>). Poor kids.",
