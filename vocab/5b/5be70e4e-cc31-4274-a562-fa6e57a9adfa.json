  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>plow</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to plow</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to till</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou need <vocabulary>to till</vocabulary> your land because you want to have a <reading>tige</reading>r <reading>ya</reading>rd (<ja>たがや</ja>). That's either when you have a yard full of live tigers, or you plant bushes and shape them into tigers. I hope it's the second kind of tiger yard. Either way, you have to plow the land to get it ready.",
