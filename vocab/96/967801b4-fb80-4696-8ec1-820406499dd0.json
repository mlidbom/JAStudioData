  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: This has the same reading as <ja>暑い</ja>, so if you've learned that you'll know how to read this word as well. If you haven't run into that word, you've probably run into the kanji <ja>暑</ja> at least. That uses the reading <ja>あつ</ja>. Two similar concepts, but there are two kanji to differentiate, which gets confusing. ",
