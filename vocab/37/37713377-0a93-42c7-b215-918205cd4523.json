You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou seem <vocabulary>to mourn for</vocabulary> things you really care about. Well then you would mourn for your <reading>toe mura</reading>l (<ja>とむら</ja>). You had a mural made for your favorite toe so if anything were to happen to it, you would want to mourn for it.",
