  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji, but in this case the second kanji can be read with either the on'yomi or kun'yomi. This uses a less common kun'yomi of <ja>家</ja>, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf you're <vocabulary>renting a house</vocabulary>, someone has to give you the keys and let you in and stuff. You're only renting, after all. So when they let you in they'll say, \"Here's a <reading>shack</reading> for <reading>yah</reading>! (<ja>しゃくや</ja>) Enjoy!\"\n\nBy the way, in the secondary reading <ja>しゃっか</ja>, the <ja>しゃく</ja> goes to <ja>しゃっ</ja>. This reading is only used in contexts like legal documents, though, so <ja>しゃくや</ja> is likely to be far more useful for most people.",
