  "sourceMnemonic": "The \"king woman\" is the princess. How do you tell this word apart from <ja>女王</ja>, which means \"queen?\" Well, the <ja>女</ja> part comes before the <ja>王</ja> when it's a queen, because the queen always comes before the princess (they're usually pretty selfish in the stories, right?). As for the princess, the <ja>女</ja> comes after the king, because she doesn't have as much power. That's why this one is <vocabulary>princess</vocabulary>.",
