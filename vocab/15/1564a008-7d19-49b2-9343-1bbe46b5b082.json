  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>obey</kanji>, and this verb is transitive, so some of its meanings refer to when you make someone obey you, or in other words <vocabulary>to preside over</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to subdue</vocabulary>. Depending on the context though, it often just means <vocabulary>to be accompanied by</vocabulary> someone. To help you remember this, imagine that everyone you're accompanied by obeys you!\n\n",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. You already learned this reading with 従う. Remember it?\n",
