Look up \"manzai\" on YouTube for some good times if you don't know what this is. It's not exactly the same, but <ja>漫</ja> DOES refer to manga, which is a type of comic book. Take the \"comic\" part from \"comic\" book, then change it to the \"haha funny!\" meaning of \"comic,\" and then imagine people doing a dialogue. Then, you have a <vocabulary>comic dialogue</vocabulary>. Lots of steps, but hopefully it'll get you there.",
