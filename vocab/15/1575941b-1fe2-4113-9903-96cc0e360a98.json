  "sourceMnemonic": "The <kanji>underworld</kanji> <kanji>dirt</kanji> is another word for the <vocabulary>realm of the dead</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>underworld</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>Hades</vocabulary>. Like the word <ja>冥界</ja> (also in this level), it's rather poetic, and mostly used in written contexts involving spirituality, Buddhism, and ancient mythologies.\n\nThere are a few set expressions that only use <ja>冥土</ja>, though. One example is <ja>冥土の土産</ja>, \"a souvenir to take to the realm of the dead\". It refers to something abstract that is so valuable, it's worth taking to the underworld, such as the solution to a great mystery, or a happy memory.\n\nAnother expression is <ja>冥土の旅支度</ja>, which means \"preparations for the journey to the realm of the dead\", and can refer to the preparation of the deceased before a funeral, as wells as certain preparations made by Buddhists while they're still alive.\n\nYou'll also see this word written as <ja>冥途</ja> sometimes.",
