  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>squeeze</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to squeeze</vocabulary>. The way that this word differs from <ja>絞る</ja> is that <ja>絞る</ja> means \"to wring out\" and <ja>搾る</ja> means to squeeze or <vocabulary>to juice</vocabulary> fruits/vegetables or <vocabulary>to milk</vocabulary> a cow.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.  You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nAfter the farmer <vocabulary>milks</vocabulary> the cow, <reading>she bow</reading>s (<ja>しぼ</ja>) to the cow to say thank you for letting her <vocabulary>squeeze</vocabulary> out some fresh milk.
