  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: \n\nA <vocabulary>good</vocabulary> way to pass the time is with a <reading>yo</reading>-yo (<ja>よ</ja>). But it better be a good yo-yo. A bad one will just fall apart.",
