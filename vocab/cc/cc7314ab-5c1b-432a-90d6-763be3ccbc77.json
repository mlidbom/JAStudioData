The kanji itself means <kanji>conflict</kanji> so the vocabulary means <vocabulary>to compete</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to argue</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to quarrel</vocabulary>. Your views conflict with someone else's so you're going to compete with them to see who's right.",

You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou're starting <vocabulary>to compete</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to argue</vocabulary> with someone, who is yelling at you: \"You <reading>are so</reading> (<ja>あらそ</ja>) stupid!\". You might want to imagine this in an accent that gets you closer to the Japanese pronunciation.",
