  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a weird word. Call it exceptional. You'll see this at train stations, especially. You know the kanji means <kanji>go</kanji>. So, something is going somewhere. Now just use the <ja>き</ja> to help you to remember that this word means <vocabulary>train direction</vocabulary> (aka it tells you which direction a train is going), because this word is the key (<ja>き</ja>) to you knowing what direction you're going in so you don't get lost. You could also remember this word as \"<vocabulary>bound for</vocabulary>\" aka \"Bound for Tokyo Station.\"",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is also an exception. It can be <ja>いき</ja>, but instead we're focusing on the <ja>ゆき</ja> reading. You have to remember the <ja>ゆ</ja> portion, so think of it this way: \n\nJust think about the <vocabulary>train direction</vocabulary> that <reading>you</reading> (<ja>ゆ</ja>) need to go in. It's all about you. Not your friends or anyone else. You. You are the most important person at this train station.",
