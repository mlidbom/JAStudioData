In Japanese, one kanji \"letter\" or \"character\" can hold a lot of information, so you have dictionaries dedicated to kanji meanings. That's what this is.\n\nThis word is a little old-fashioned these days, so you might also see <ja>漢字辞典</ja> used for a character dictionary. (You'll learn <ja>辞典</ja> soon, if you haven't already!)",
