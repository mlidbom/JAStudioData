  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>search</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to search for</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to seek</vocabulary>.\n\nCurious about the difference between <ja>捜す</ja> and <ja>探す</ja>? While there is some overlap between the two, <ja>捜す</ja> is typically used in official, thorough searches for something or someone that is thought to concretely exist and has disappeared or cannot be easily found. In contrast, <ja>探す</ja> can also be used for personal searches for things that one desires or is looking for.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're searching all around for a \"<reading>sagger</reading>\" (<ja>さが</ja>) on your body. This is a flap of skin that is sagging on your body really far, and you probably should get it removed.",
