  "sourceMnemonic": "When you <kanji>raise</kanji> something you are causing it <vocabulary>to be raised</vocabulary>. This verb can also mean things like <vocabulary>to be listed</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to be nominated</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to rise</vocabulary>. For these additional meanings, you might want to imagine something rising up onto a list or someone rising up to a nomination, because lists and nominations are always high up.\n\n",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThe reading for this is the same as the other \"to rise\" word, <ja>上がる</ja>. Nice how that works, right? So, just associate the two and you have yourself a reading.",
