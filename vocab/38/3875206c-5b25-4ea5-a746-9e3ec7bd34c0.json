  "sourceMnemonic": "The <ja>の</ja> particle makes it so the <ja>人</ja> belongs to the <ja>女</ja>. Basically, this literally means \"a woman person\" or \"a person of woman.\" It's a more polite way to say plain old woman, though, so all you have to remember is that.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This word is actually two separate words combined with a particle. So, since you treat them like separate words, you read each of them with the kun'yomi readings (they are both single kanji words all alone). That being said, in level 1 you learned about the vocab readings for these separate words, so use that knowledge to remember the reading for this word as well.",
