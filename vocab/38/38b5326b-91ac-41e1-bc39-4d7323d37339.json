  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>retreat</kanji>, and the verb vocab version means <vocabulary>to retreat</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to withdraw</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to resign</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou need <vocabulary>to retreat</vocabulary> because <reading>she re-zo</reading>ned (<ja>しりぞ</ja>) where you are standing. Now this is a no standing zone. Who is she? The re-zoner, duh. ",
