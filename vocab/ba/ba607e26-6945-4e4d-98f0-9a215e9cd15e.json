  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the two words <ja>禅</ja> and <ja>寺</ja> put together. The <ja>てら</ja> gets changed to <ja>でら</ja>, though.\n\nIn terms of when it's pronounced <ja>ぜんじ</ja>, if you put this word onto the end of the name of a <ja>禅寺</ja> the pronunciation changes to <ja>ぜんじ</ja>. It makes sense - it's more like a jukugo word that way (not that the original isn't, but you can see the separation of words coming together which gives the hint that it's a kun'yomi combo reading). Anyways, you may need a zen temple to keep your mind pure enough to remember this, but it's a good thing to keep in mind if you can.",
