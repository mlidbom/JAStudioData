When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: When you come to confess your <vocabulary>sin</vocabulary> to me, you start claiming it wasn't you. You say it was some other version of you! What? How could this be? Well, you say \"there are <reading>two me</reading>s (<ja>つみ</ja>) out there!\" One is doing the bad stuff, and the other is you, and you haven't done any sins!",
