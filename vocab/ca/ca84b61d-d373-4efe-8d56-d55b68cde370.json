  "sourceMnemonic": "You know the kanji is <kanji>substitute</kanji>, and you know this is a verb. There are other similar ones, but this one means <vocabulary>to replace something</vocabulary>. In order to remember that this particular word means \"to replace something\" focus in on the <ja>え</ja>. You have an egg in your hands that you notice isn't any good (it's black and moldy). So, you replace it with another egg (or substitute it with another egg, or exchange it with another egg, etc).\n\nThis verb is transitive, meaning it has a direct object. You replace something, like that egg!",
