  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>stream</kanji>. If you're streaming water, it might be <vocabulary>to flush something</vocabulary>. Alternatively, <vocabulary>to pour something</vocabulary> makes a stream of liquid, and <vocabulary>to set something afloat</vocabulary> is to make something flow in the stream.",

You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWhat do you do with someone who is a <reading>nagger</reading> (one who nags)? You have <vocabulary>to flush</vocabulary> them down the toilet. Imagine someone nagging you to do your chores so you flush them down the toilet, somehow.",
