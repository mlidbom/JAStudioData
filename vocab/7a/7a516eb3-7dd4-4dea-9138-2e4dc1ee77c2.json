  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This kanji uses the kun'yomi readings for each kanji, for some reason. You learned the kun'yomi reading for <ja>戸</ja>, but in this case it's rendaku'd so it becomes <ja>ど</ja> instead of <ja>と</ja>. You didn't learn the kun'yomi version of <ja>井</ja> with the kanji. Think of this <vocabulary>well</vocabulary>, and look inside. There you see an <reading>ea</reading>gle (<ja>い</ja>), stuck inside. As you pull it out, it scratches your eyes out.",
