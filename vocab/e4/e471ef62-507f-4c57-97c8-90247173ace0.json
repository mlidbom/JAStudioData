  "sourceMnemonic": "This word means <vocabulary>to understand</vocabulary>, which might surprise you if you remember that the kanji <ja>分</ja> means \"part\" or \"parts.\" Think of it this way: to understand something you have to break it down into its parts to see how it works.\n\nWatch out, though, because whereas in English you understand something, in Japanese the thing you understand is the grammatical subject (it's doing the action). So, a more literal meaning for this is <vocabulary>to be understandable</vocabulary>. In other words, there's no object, and <ja>分かる</ja> is intransitive, meaning it happens on its own. The <ja>かる</ja> ending is a hint, because verbs with <ja>かる</ja> as okurigana (kana added to the kanji) are usually intransitive.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou scream \"<reading>WAHHHHHH</reading>\" (<ja>わ</ja>) in terror and \"<reading>CAAA</reading>R!!!\" (<ja>か</ja>) as you careen down the freeway. Your dad is driving like a maniac and almost hit another car! \"<reading>WAAH CAAA</reading>R!!!\" (<ja>わか</ja>) you scream again. If only he understood your terror!",
