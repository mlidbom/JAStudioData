  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>drunk</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to be drunk</vocabulary>.\n\nThis drunk feeling also happens to some people in boats and cars. But we call that <vocabulary>to be seasick</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be carsick</vocabulary>. You aren't actually drunk, but you feel like you are (and you're probably gonna puke, yuck!).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "I'm not drunk, <reading>yo</reading> (<ja>よ</ja>). YO. I'm not drunk, yo. YO. Yo, I'm not drunk. Yo.",
