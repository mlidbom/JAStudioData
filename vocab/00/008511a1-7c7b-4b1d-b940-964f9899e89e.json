You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWhen thinking about the <vocabulary>circumstance</vocabulary> of your current situation and the <vocabulary>reason</vocabulary> you're there (which is studying kanji and vocab). Whose fault is it? It's WaniKani's fault! But, your brain has been beaten to a mush from all the studying, so when you say \"it's your fault\" it comes out as \"it's <reading>yue</reading> fault!\" Go ahead and say it out loud that way.",
