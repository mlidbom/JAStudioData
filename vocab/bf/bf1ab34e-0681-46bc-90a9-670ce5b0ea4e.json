  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.  You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWhat do you want <vocabulary>to tie</vocabulary> up? Your <reading>Shiba</reading> (<ja>しば</ja>) Inu!
