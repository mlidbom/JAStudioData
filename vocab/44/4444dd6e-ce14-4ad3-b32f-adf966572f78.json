  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: \n\nWhat do you use your <vocabulary>finger</vocabulary> for the most? For pointing, of course! Imagine going up to people and saying, \"What will <reading>you be</reading> (<ja>ゆび</ja>) when you grow up?\" Point your finger at the next person, \"What will you be?\" Keep going until you're just saying, \"You be? You be?\" with your finger out.",
