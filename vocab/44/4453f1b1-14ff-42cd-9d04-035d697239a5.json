  "sourceMnemonic": "The <kanji>temporary</kanji> <kanji>name</kanji>s. These are the <vocabulary>kana</vocabulary> (that's hiragana and katakana). Why are the \"temporary names\" kana, though? Perhaps they were never meant to be a main way to write the names of the kanji... They are just a temporary way to write the name of kanji you don't know how to write the \"correct\" way (aka kanji)? That's just a guess, but it should help you to remember that this word means \"kana,\" at least.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading for <ja>仮</ja> is the one you learned with the kanji. The <ja>名</ja> portion is not, however, and uses its kun'yomi reading (<ja>な</ja>), which you saw with the vocabulary word <ja>名</ja> (<ja>な</ja>). How to remember all this, though? Think of it this way: \n\nThe people who made kanji really don't want you to know <vocabulary>kana</vocabulary>. It's bad for business. They want anyone who uses the word \"kana\" to suffer, so they decided to make one part on'yomi and another part kun'yomi. Don't let them get you!",
