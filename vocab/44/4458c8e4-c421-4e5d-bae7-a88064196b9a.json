  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>publish</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to be published</vocabulary>. Books can be published, magazines can be published, and I guess even your gross blog posts get published too.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\n\"Hey, were you able <vocabulary>to be published</vocabulary> yet?\" someone asks, and the answer is always <reading>NO</reading> (<ja>の</ja>)! It's never your time to get published. The answer is always no... because no one likes (sniff) what you write (sob).",
