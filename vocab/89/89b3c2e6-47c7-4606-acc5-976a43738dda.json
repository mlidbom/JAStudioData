  "sourceMnemonic": "A <kanji>person</kanji> whose <kanji>name</kanji> is known (because he's <kanji>famous</kanji>?). Why is this person's name known? Why is this person famous? It's because they are an <vocabulary>expert</vocabulary> / <vocabulary>master</vocabulary> at something. How else does someone become famous or well-known? That's pretty much it, even if they're just an expert at being an idiot.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since <ja>人</ja> has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nDid you know that every <vocabulary>expert</vocabulary> has their own pair of <reading>May</reading> <reading>jean</reading>s (<ja>めいじん</ja>)? A true <vocabulary>master</vocabulary> of anything has a specific pair of jeans they wear only in the month of May. That's what makes them so good at what they do.",
