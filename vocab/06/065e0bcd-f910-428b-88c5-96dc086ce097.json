  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>incur</kanji> so you'd think this would mean \"to incur,\" but it doesn't. This is <vocabulary>to put on a hat</vocabulary>. Yep, it's the verb that's made for putting on hats. So, think of it this way. You \"<kanji>incur</kanji>\" a hat when you go <vocabulary>to wear a hat</vocabulary>. Pretty weird but you'll get it if you put on your thinking cap.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nThe hat that you put on is way too heavy for you. It falls off your head and hits the ground with a loud <reading>KABOO</reading>M (<ja>かぶ</ja>). You put it back on and pull it down tight, but this time it pulls you to the ground with an even louder KABOOM!",
