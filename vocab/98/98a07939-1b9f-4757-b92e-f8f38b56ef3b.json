For most people that is some nice <vocabulary>music</vocabulary>. Just be sure you don't put on any Bieber... that would be like <ja>不音楽</ja> or something... I kid, I kid.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <ja>楽</ja> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf you play your <vocabulary>music</vocabulary> too loud, people will come and <reading>gawk</reading> (<ja>がく</ja>) at you. But if you try to turn it off and say, \"OH I DON'T LIKE MUSIC ANYWAY!\" they'll gawk at you even more. Learn proper music etiquette and people won't gawk at you so much, okay?",
