  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>pain</kanji>, and this verb is transitive, so it means to inflict pain. In other words, it's <vocabulary>to injure something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to hurt someone</vocabulary>.\n\nThis verb focusses on the pain involved in an injury, so it can only be used for things that feel pain, like people and body parts.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. You learned that reading with the word <ja>痛い</ja>.",
