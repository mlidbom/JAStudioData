  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>call</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to respectfully call</vocabulary>. It can also be used as <vocabulary>to respectfully eat</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to respectfully invite</vocabulary> too. It's a really useful word like that. As long as you remember it's the respectful/honorific way of doing things you should be fine.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nIf you want <vocabulary>to respectfully call</vocabulary> out to someone you need to make sure you don't look them in the <ja><reading>目</reading></ja> (<ja>め</ja>) because that's super rude. Always remember to turn your <ja>目</ja> away to show respect.",
