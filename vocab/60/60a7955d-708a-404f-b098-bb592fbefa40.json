  "sourceMnemonic": "Your <kanji>bad</kanji> <kanji>mouth</kanji> produces nothing but <vocabulary>bad-mouthing</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>trash-talk</vocabulary>.\n\n<ja>悪口</ja> often targets someone's character, appearance, or abilities, with the intention of hurting them or damaging their reputation, sometimes to their face, but often behind their back. It gives rise to unfavorable information that can spread though gossip.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the kun'yomi vocab readings for these two kanji, probably because this word is just two words put together into one (bad + mouth). Use your knowledge of the vocab words <ja>悪い</ja> and <ja>口</ja> to learn the reading of this word.\n\nOkay, I lied. You should actually do\u00A0<ja>わるぐち</ja>\u00A0instead. <ja>わるくち</ja> is possible, but the rendaku version is way more common. Sorry to say such bad things before.",
