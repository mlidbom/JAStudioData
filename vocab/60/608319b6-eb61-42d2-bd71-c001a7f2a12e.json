  "sourceMnemonic": "This word contains the words <ja>気</ja> (energy) and <ja>付ける</ja> (to attach). So, when you <kanji>attach</kanji> <kanji>energy</kanji> to something you're focusing in on it, right? This word is a sort of \"order\" as well, since it's te-form there at the end. It's a set phrase people say to other people who are doing dangerous things. It's kind of like saying \"Attach energy to what you're doing! Stay focused!\" A simpler way to translate this would be to say this word means <vocabulary>be careful</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>take care</vocabulary>, though. Learn this word so that you can always show that you're caring for your friends!",
