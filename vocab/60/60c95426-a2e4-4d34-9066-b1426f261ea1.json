  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>exhausted</kanji> and the verb version means <vocabulary>to become exhausted</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to become tired</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to get tired</vocabulary>. Don't confuse this with \"to be sleepy.\" No, this is a different kind of tired, like a physical or mental one, like you just worked out or studied a ton.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "For example, if you tried to lift <reading>two ca</reading>rs (<ja>つか</ja>) you'd become exhausted for sure. So, think about that as you learn this word's reading.",
