  "sourceMnemonic": "You know that <ja>山</ja> means mountain. Add the hiragana <ja>びこ</ja> to the end and this gives you <vocabulary>echo</vocabulary>. That's because bee children (bee <ja>子</ja>) love echos, especially <vocabulary>mountain echo</vocabulary>s! Imagine baby bees buzzing as loudly as they can and hearing their voices echoing back at them through the mountains.\n\nAs the kanji suggests, <ja>山びこ</ja> is generally used to describe the echo you get if you shout in the mountains. To decribe other types of echo, you can use the katakana word <ja>エコー</ja>.\n\nBy the way, there is actually a kanji for the second part of this word, but it's so rare that it's usually written in kana!",
