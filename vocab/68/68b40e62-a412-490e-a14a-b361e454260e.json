  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The readings for this one are the kun'yomi readings of each kanji. <ja>子</ja> is just <ja>こ</ja>, like the individual vocab word. <ja>供</ja> is <ja><reading>ども</reading></ja>, however. Remember this by thinking how much <vocabulary>children</vocabulary> love <reading>domo</reading>-kun.\n\nAlso, <ja>子ども</ja> is kind of more \"politically correct\" with the kana hanging off there. <ja>子供</ja> is still used in a lot of situations, usually stiff ones. The second kanji means servant, and some people don't like that. The second version pops up a decent amount, so it's good to be familiar with that as well.",
