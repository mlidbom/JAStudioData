  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nThis is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. Something comes to a stop. No direct object here. That's why this verb means <vocabulary>to stop</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou come to a stop sign and decide <vocabulary>to stop</vocabulary> because the sign has a picture of a <reading>toe</reading> (<ja>と</ja>) on it. This toe looks eerily like a toe your Ma (<ja>ま</ja>) has too... and your Ma always taught you to stop and look both ways before crossing her toes.",
