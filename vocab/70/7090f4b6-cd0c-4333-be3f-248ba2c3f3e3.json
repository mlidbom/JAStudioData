  "sourceMnemonic": "Ah yes, <kanji>wet</kanji> <kanji>clothes</kanji> must be wet clothes-NOT! This used to mean \"wet clothes\" a long, long time ago, but these days it's used for <vocabulary>false accusations</vocabulary>. Think of it this way: if you make false, baseless accusations, it's like you're dumping water all over someone for no reason. ",
