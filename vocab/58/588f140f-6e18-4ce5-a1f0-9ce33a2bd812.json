  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading for this word is quite strange. If you know <ja>二つ</ja>'s reading, you can use that to remember the <ja>二</ja> part (<ja>ふた</ja>). But, the <ja>り</ja> that is the <ja>人</ja> is a total exception, something you won't see too often (though you may have seen it in <ja>一人</ja>). If you can use the reading of <ja>一人</ja> (aka if you've learned it already) then definitely use that. If not, do your best to remember the reading on your own. It's a strange one that doesn't connect to much else.",
