  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>suffer</kanji>, and the verb is all about when you make someone else suffer. That's why it's <vocabulary>to hurt someone</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to torment</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to harass</vocabulary>.\n\nYou need to differentiate this from <ja>苦しむ</ja>, which is about when YOU suffer. You can remember that <ja>苦しめる</ja> is about making someone else suffer with this mnemonic: Who made you suffer? She (<ja>し</ja>) made me (<ja>め</ja>) suffer! She's so mean!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "By now, you've learned 苦しい and 苦しむ. The kanji in these words all use the same reading! Yay! \n",
