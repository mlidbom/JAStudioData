  "sourceMnemonic": "This is the adverb version of <kanji>未</kanji>, so it means the same thing: <vocabulary>not yet</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>still</vocabulary>, depending on the context.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn it with this kanji, so here a mnemonic to help you:\n\nSomeone's telling you \"<vocabulary>not yet</vocabulary>... not yet.... not yet...\". You have some food on your nose, but you're not allowed to eat it\u00A0<reading>今</reading>\u00A0(<ja>いま</ja>).\n\nNote that\u00A0this word can also be read <ja>まだ</ja>. However,\u00A0<ja>いまだ</ja>\u00A0is often written in kanji, while\u00A0<ja>まだ</ja>\u00A0is almost always written in kana. So when you see\u00A0<ja>未だ</ja>, it's a safe bet to read it as\u00A0<ja>いまだ</ja>!",
