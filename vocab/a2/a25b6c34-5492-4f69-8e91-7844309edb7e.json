  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means \"<kanji>exit</kanji>\" and this is kind of a verb form of this. The word means <vocabulary>to take out</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to hand out</vocabulary>, so it's like you're doing the action of causing something else to exit (rather than exiting yourself).\n\nIn other words, this verb is transitive, like most verbs ending in <ja>す</ja>. You can remember this because the hiragana <ja>す</ja> is like the word \"sue.\" You're taking out way too much of something, and someone's going to <reading>sue</reading> (<ja>す</ja>) you for it.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The part of the word that you have to learn how to read is the <ja>だ</ja> portion. So, you already removed Sue from the box. Who else is in there that you have to remove? It's your <reading>Da</reading>d (<ja>だ</ja>) as well. Go ahead and remove him from the box as well.",
