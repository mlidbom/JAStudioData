  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: Your <vocabulary>liver</vocabulary> isn't doing great. You have cancer in your liver, so now they're giving you <reading>chemo</reading> (<ja>きも</ja>) to help get rid of that cancer.",
