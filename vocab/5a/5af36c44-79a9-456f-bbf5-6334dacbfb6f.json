  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. <ja>出口</ja> is an exception to this rule, however, and uses its kun'yomi readings. There's no particular reason why this is, but oftentimes a \"body part\" word (like mouth) changes a word to use kun'yomi readings instead of on'yomi ones. You already know the kun'yomi reading for <ja>口</ja> (<ja>くち</ja>) from learning the vocab, but to remember the reading for <ja>出</ja> you can think the following:\n\nIf I exit out this mouth, I'll end up in the ocean (you were swallowed by a whale) and I will surely end up <reading>dea</reading>d (<ja>で</ja>).\n\nAlso keep in mind that because of rendaku, <ja>くち</ja> becomes <ja>ぐち</ja>.",
