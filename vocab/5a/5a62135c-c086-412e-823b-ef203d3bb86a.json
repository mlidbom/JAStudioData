So this means <vocabulary>someone else</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>other people</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is more general than <ja>他人</ja>, which you already learned. <ja>他の人</ja> can be anyone that's not the speaker, or not the person being talked about. <ja>他人</ja>, on the other hand, has an added implication that the person is someone unknown or unrelated.",
