  "sourceMnemonic": "You'll have to learn this word in two parts. You already know the meaning of <ja>今</ja> because of the kanji, which means \"now.\" The <ja>すぐ</ja> part, however, is a new word, meaning \"soon.\" <ja>すぐ</ja> and \"soon\" even start with a similar sound, so maybe that can help you remember this! If you put <ja>今</ja> and <ja>すぐ</ja> together, you get \"now soon.\" Put in better English, that's <vocabulary>at once</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>right now</vocabulary>.",
