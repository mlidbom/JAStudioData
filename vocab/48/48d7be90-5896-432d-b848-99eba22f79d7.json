This word is a little less specific than <ja>股間</ja>, which you already learned. It can even be used to refer to the thigh, though in that case the reading is usually <ja>もも</ja> and it's mostly written in hiragana or katakana.\n\nThis can also be used for a <vocabulary>fork</vocabulary> in a road or path, which makes sense when you think about it, doesn't it?",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "You learned the on’yomi for this kanji, but like many kanji it takes the kun’yomi when used by itself. You haven't learned the kun’yomi yet, so here’s a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou’ve spilled something on your <vocabulary>crotch</vocabulary> again (<ja>また</ja>, get it?) but your pants are so stained at this point that it doesn’t even <reading>matter</reading> (<ja>また</ja>).",
