  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>boots</kanji>, but \"to boots\" doesn't make sense. What actions do you do with boots, though, usually? You put them on. That's why this word is <vocabulary>to put on shoes</vocabulary> (or boots, I guess). It's also <vocabulary>to put on pants</vocabulary>, probably because it's all kind of the same motion, no?",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You decide <vocabulary>to put on shoes</vocabulary>. That will teach Mrs. Chou and her streets! \"<reading>HA</reading> (<ja>は</ja>) HA HA!\" you laugh out loud like a maniac.",
