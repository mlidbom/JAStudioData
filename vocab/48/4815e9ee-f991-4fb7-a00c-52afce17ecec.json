  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>think</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to think about</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to consider</vocabulary>. \n\nNote that this isn't the \"to think\" that is like \"I think that he is a power ranger.\" No, this is more like the actual thinking action. That's why this word is \"to think about\" or \"to consider\" rather than plain old \"to think\" which is <ja>思う</ja>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "If you want <vocabulary>to think</vocabulary>, the best way to do so is to do the <reading>conga</reading> (<ja>かんが</ja>). Imagine yourself doing the conga and thinking away. You're so inspired! The thoughts are flowing as freely as your sweet, slow dance moves.",
