  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>pull</kanji> and the verb version vocab means <vocabulary>to pull</vocabulary>.\n\nThis word has other meanings too! When you <kanji>pull</kanji> numbers away from other numbers, what you're really doing is subtracting them. That's why this word also means <vocabulary>to subtract</vocabulary>. And when you <kanji>pull</kanji> something towards you, that's <vocabulary>to attract</vocabulary> it.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. The reading (<ja>ひ</ja>) is the same as the one you learned for the kanji, meaning you should already know it!",
