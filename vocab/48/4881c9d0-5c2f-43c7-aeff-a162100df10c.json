  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>pass through</kanji> so the verb vocab version means things like <vocabulary>to pass through</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to pass</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to travel along</vocabulary>, and <vocabulary>to stop by</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThere's something in front of you that you have <vocabulary>to pass through</vocabulary> but you can't. It's a wall. In order to pass through it, you decide to kick it as hard as you can to knock it down. Unfortunately, it is way stronger than you, and your toe explodes on contact. You yell: \"<reading>TOE! OH!</reading>\" (<ja>とお</ja>) and then just scream a lot.",
