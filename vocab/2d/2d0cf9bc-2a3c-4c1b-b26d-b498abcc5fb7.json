  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>catch</kanji> so the intransitive verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to be caught</vocabulary>. This is a literal, physical catch. So, for example, you can catch a criminal using this verb but not catch the drift of an idea, which would be <ja>捕える</ja>, coming up in level 27.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is <ja>つか</ja>, so to remember that with <vocabulary>to be caught</vocabulary>, think about how you're a police officer trying to catch some criminals. Unfortunately, they have split up into <reading>two ca</reading>rs (<ja>つか</ja>) meaning you won't catch both of them, since you only have one car.",
