  "sourceMnemonic": "Remember how you learned that <ja>縛る</ja> means \"to bind?\" Well, in Japanese being bound by <kanji>gold</kanji> means you're experiencing <vocabulary>sleep paralysis</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>temporary paralysis</vocabulary>. Just imagine that you're waking from a dream where you're bound up in gold thread, and it's stopping you from moving.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a combination of the words <ja>金</ja> and <ja>縛る</ja>. Both use the kun'yomi readings, but <ja>金</ja> becomes <ja>かな</ja> instead of <ja>かね</ja>. If you can remember that exception, this should be easy!",
