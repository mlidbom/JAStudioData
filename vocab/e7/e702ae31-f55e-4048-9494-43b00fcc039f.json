  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\n<vocabulary>Shell</vocabulary>s come from (<ja><reading>から</reading></ja>) living animals. You can't have a shell — or a <reading>cara</reading>pace (<ja>から</ja>) — unless something was once in there. They have to come from something.\n\nThis word isn't limited to animal shells though! It covers seed shells, or husks, too.",
