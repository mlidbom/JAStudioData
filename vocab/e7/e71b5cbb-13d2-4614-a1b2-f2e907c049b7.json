The kanji itself means\u00A0<kanji>dwell</kanji>, so the verb version means\u00A0<vocabulary>to live</vocabulary>,\u00A0<vocabulary>to reside</vocabulary>, or of course <vocabulary>to dwell</vocabulary>. Basically, someone is living somewhere. Where do you live?",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.

You are being <reading>sue</reading>d (<ja>す</ja>) out of your house and home so you will have nowhere <vocabulary>to dwell</vocabulary>.",
