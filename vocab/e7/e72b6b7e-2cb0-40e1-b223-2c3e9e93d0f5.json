  "sourceMnemonic": "You should <kanji>congratulate</kanji> a person who speaks lots of <kanji>dialect</kanji>s because they have to be a really <vocabulary>strong person</vocabulary>, just like Mr. <vocabulary>Benkei</vocabulary> was. You think learning Japanese is hard now, just wait till you hear Osaka-ben and Hokkaido-ben. It takes a really strong person — a Benkei — to learn all those dialects, so congratulate them and tell them how strong they are!\n\n<ja>弁慶</ja> is the name of a Japanese historical figure who was really strong, so Benkei is the Japanese equivalent of Hercules or Achilles in Western languages.",
