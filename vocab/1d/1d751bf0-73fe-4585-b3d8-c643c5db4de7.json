  "sourceMnemonic": "You've seen how <ja>倒す</ja> is \"to knock over.\" But this is when something gets knocked over by itself. You know that you're not doing anything here, because when you're not touching all these fine glass items, it's very <reading>rare</reading> (<ja>れる</ja>) that anything gets knocked over (because you're not touching anything, you clumsy dumsy). It's also when you or someone else collapses. You didn't push yourself over, you just kind of fell by yourself.",
