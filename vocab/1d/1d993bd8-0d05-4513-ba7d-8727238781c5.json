That is the verb version of this word, which means \"to pass through.\" So, if this is the noun version, what is it that you use to pass through something? To drive or walk along? That would be an <vocabulary>avenue</vocabulary> (or <vocabulary>street</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>road</vocabulary>, etc). This is a pretty common word in Japan, and good for not getting lost.",
