  "sourceMnemonic": "The kanji means <kanji>wound</kanji>, and this verb is transitive, so it means <vocabulary>to damage something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to injure something</vocabulary>.\n\nYou can use it to talk about parts of your body, so you'll sometimes see it used interchangeably with <ja>痛める</ja>. The difference is that it's objectively focussing on the damage, not the pain. That's why <ja>傷める</ja> can be used for objects like cars and furniture, too, whereas <ja>痛める</ja> is only for people and body parts.",
