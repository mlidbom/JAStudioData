  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\n\nYou have this <vocabulary>container</vocabulary>. It's upside down with a stick holding it up and a string on the stick. You're going to catch some U2s (like, the band). You put some food under it and wait. Then, out of the bushes comes Bono. He sniffs around for a bit and then goes under the container. You pull! <reading>U2 wa</reading>lked (<ja>うつわ</ja>) right into the trap! Haha!",
