  "sourceMnemonic": "Remember how <ja>自動詞</ja> was \"intransitive verb\"? Intransitive verbs are when something just happens. You aren't doing the action to them. This word, however, is the other kind. A <vocabulary>transitive verb</vocabulary> is when you are directly doing something to something else. That's why it has <kanji>other</kanji> in there, because it's a <kanji>verb</kanji> (<ja>動詞</ja>) you do to an<kanji>other</kanji> thing, directly.",
