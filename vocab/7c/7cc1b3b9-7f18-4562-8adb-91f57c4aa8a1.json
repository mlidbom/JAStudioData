  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>deposit</kanji>, and you already learned a similar word that means the same thing as the kanji, <ja>預ける</ja>. With this verb, someone is depositing something (or someone) with you, because they want you <vocabulary>to look after</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to take care of</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to hold on to</vocabulary> it.\n\nTo differentiate it with <ja>預ける</ja>, think of the <ja>か</ja> in <ja>預かる</ja>. The only thing you're willing to look after is your <reading>car</reading> (<ja>か</ja>), and nothing else! Someone asks you to look after their kids? Sorry, nothing doing, you're busy taking care of your car. Can you hold on to someone's luggage for them? Nope, your car takes priority.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this before with the pair verb <ja>預ける</ja>, but here's a mnemonic to remind you just in case:\n\nYou need someone <vocabulary>to look after</vocabulary> your kids for the day. Hey I have an idea! Leave them with the monkeys at <reading>a zoo</reading> (<ja>あず</ja>)! Monkeys love kids, and kids love monkeys. Now you can zoom off in your <reading>car</reading>s (<ja>か</ja>) for the day!",
