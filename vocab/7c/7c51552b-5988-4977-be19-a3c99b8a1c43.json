  "sourceMnemonic": "A <ja>形容詞</ja> is an <kanji>adjective</kanji>. So what about an adjective with a <ja>動詞</ja> (verb) in there? How does that make sense? I'm not entirely sure either, but an adjective with movement in it is a <vocabulary>na adjective</vocabulary>. These are the adjectives that can end with <ja>な</ja> (<ja>便利な</ja>, for example). In fact, they're more like nouns than they are verbs, so what gives? Whatever it is, just decide you don't want to deal with this craziness. Just say <reading>nah</reading>, I don't care about this anymore.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. It will help to know <ja>形容詞</ja> and <ja>動詞</ja> as well, since they're both parts of this word.",
