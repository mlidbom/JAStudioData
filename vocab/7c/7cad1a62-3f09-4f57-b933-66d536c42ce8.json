  "sourceMnemonic": "The place that's <kanji>famous</kanji> for <kanji>old</kanji> <kanji>roof</kanji>s. I don't know why, but it's the city of <vocabulary>Nagoya</vocabulary>. Just associate the two things together and it'll be hard to forget (so long as you've heard of Nagoya before - if not, read up about it!).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji (except for <ja>名</ja> and <ja>屋</ja>, which are kun'yomi here). If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. For <ja>な</ja> just think to <ja>名前</ja> (<ja>なまえ</ja>) which uses the <ja>な</ja> reading. The \"name\" (<ja>名前</ja>) of this city is what? It's <reading>Na</reading>goya. Watch out for rendaku changing <ja>こ</ja> to <ja>ご</ja> too.",
