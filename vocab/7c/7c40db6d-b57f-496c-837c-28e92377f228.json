  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is a bit weird. It's kun'yomi readings across the board, meaning your knowledge of <ja>建てる</ja> hopefully can come into play here. A building is something you build, so how do you say \"to build\"? It's <ja>建てる</ja> (<ja>たてる</ja>). Since it's a thing you build, it's a <ja><reading>たてもの</reading></ja>. This reading is a bit confusing, but hopefully after a while you'll get it if you get it wrong too many times! Maybe if you think about the building you're in and call it a <ja>建物</ja> a few times it'll sink in better?",
