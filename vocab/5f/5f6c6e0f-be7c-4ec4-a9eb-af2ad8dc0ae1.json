  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Everything is so <vocabulary>easy</vocabulary> for you to do. Why? Because you don't do anything yourself. You ask others. You say things like \"Hey, can you get me some water?\" They say \"<reading>yassah!</reading>\" (<ja>やさ</ja>) very enthusiastically.",
