You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nTouch something that's warm... too warm! You pull your hand back and go \"<reading>AH ta ta!</reading> (<ja>あたた</ja>). People make this noise when they touch something that's hot, I hear. It's almost like saying \"hot hot hot\" while dropping the \"h\" sound.",
