  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>teach</kanji>, and this verb means <vocabulary>to learn something from someone</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be taught something</vocabulary>. When you use this verb, you're not learning something by yourself, you're being taught by someone else.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this kun'yomi yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWhen you want <vocabulary>to learn something from someone</vocabulary>, you say \"<reading>Oh</reading>, <reading>so</reading>...\" (おそ) and repeat what you've just learned. Saying \"oh, so…\" helps you make sure you're understanding correctly, and shows you're really paying attention. That's important when you're learning from someone!",
