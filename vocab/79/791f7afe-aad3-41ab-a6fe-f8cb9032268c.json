  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>sink</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to sink</vocabulary>. \n\nThis is a transitive verb, so it's used when you're sinking something else. You can differentiate it from the intransitive <ja>沈む</ja> by imaging that you're watching an enemy ship sink, and they shout out, \"Who did this to me!\" You respond, <reading>me</reading> (<ja>め</ja>). I did.\" ",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "When you sink something, like a battleship, you go on and say: \"<reading>she's</reading> (<ja>しず</ja>) sunk, I sunk her.\" That's like your tagline, or something. You say it for some reason because you think it's cool.",
