  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>stream</kanji>? It's <vocabulary>to stream</vocabulary> (though it's also <vocabulary>to flow</vocabulary>, a very similar word). You can differentiate this from <ja>流す</ja> because with <ja>流す</ja> you flush something down the toilet, which causes it to overflow so you <reading>sue</reading> (<ja>す</ja>) the toilet maker. With <ja>流れる</ja> you find a <reading>rare</reading> (<ja>れる</ja>) jewel trying to flow down the river. You grab it, and see it's a rare diamond!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as <ja>流す</ja>. So long as you know that you should be able to read this one as well!",
