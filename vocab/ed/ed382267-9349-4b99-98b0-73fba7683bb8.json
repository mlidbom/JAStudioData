Maybe you're \"anti respond\" but you have no choice, you have to give <vocabulary>a response</vocabulary> despite that fact?",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The <ja>反</ja> reading is all good and merry, but the <ja>応</ja> reading gets a bit wonky, turning into <ja>のう</ja>. This is probably because it's just way easier to say than <ja>はんおう</ja> and sounds basically the same too. So, <ja>はんおう</ja> goes to <ja>はんのう</ja> and everyone's happy. Do you have <vocabulary>a response</vocabulary>? \n\nThe reading <ja>はんおう</ja> is also going to be included since it's technically correct though a less common spelling.",
