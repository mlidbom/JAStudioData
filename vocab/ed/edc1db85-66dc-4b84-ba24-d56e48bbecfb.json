  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>stab</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to stab</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a transitive verb, meaning that you are the one doing the stabbing... should I be afraid of you? \uD83D\uDE05",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "If you're going <vocabulary>to stab</vocabulary> someone, use a <reading>saw</reading> (<ja>さ</ja>). It may seem more difficult to stab them with a saw at first, but when you see the damage, plus how hard it is to get back out, you'll realize a saw is the ideal stabbing tool.",
