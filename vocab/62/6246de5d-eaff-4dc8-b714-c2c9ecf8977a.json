So, you'll hear this word used when someone wants to describe this unique sense of style. Wafuuuu! \n\nNote that this word uses alternative kanji meanings in both of the kanji. They're in the kanji explanation, but they're not the primaries, so it may take a little extra effort to learn this word depending on what you studied!",
