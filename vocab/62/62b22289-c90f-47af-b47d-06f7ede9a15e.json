When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\nYou cut yourself and there's <vocabulary>blood</vocabulary> everywhere. You need to stop the bleeding with something, but the only thing nearby is a block of <reading>chee</reading>se. You grab the cheese and stuff it into your gash, but the blood comes out the holes (it is Swiss cheese, blargh!). Imagine this in great detail to be able to remember it well.",
