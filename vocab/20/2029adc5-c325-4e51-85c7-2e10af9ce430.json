  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>cut off</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to cut off</vocabulary>. Don't confuse this with <ja>断る</ja> which means \"to refuse.\" You know this is <vocabulary>to cut off</vocabulary> because of the <ja>つ</ja>, which hints that you have had <reading>two</reading> (<ja>つ</ja>) too many chocolates, and it's time to cut you off.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "URGH! The reading isn't even the same as <ja>断る</ja>, how frustrating. <vocabulary>to cut off</vocabulary> is read as <ja><reading>たつ</reading></ja>. Instead of eating too many chocolates and getting cut off, maybe you're eating too many tater <reading>tots</reading> (<ja>たつ</ja>). Don't eat so many of those, it's unhealthy. You have <vocabulary>to cut off</vocabulary> tater tots from your diet so you don't get fat.",
