  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>change</kanji> so you'd think the verb version is \"to change\" but it's a little different. This word means <vocabulary>to transform oneself</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be transformed</vocabulary>, which is a lot like \"to change\" but this is more like when a person transforms themself into something else, like a dinosaur.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou try to transform. You want to turn into something awesome, like a dinosaur, but then *poof* you turn into a sheep. \"<reading>Ba</reading>aaa,\" you say. \"Baaa.\"",
