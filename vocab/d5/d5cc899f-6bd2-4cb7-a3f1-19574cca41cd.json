  "sourceMnemonic": "Just look at this word. What do you think it means? That's right - it's a name (Fuji) plus the kanji for <kanji>mountain</kanji>. Put those together, and you have <vocabulary>Mount Fuji</vocabulary>. In English the \"Mount(ain)\" part comes first. In Japanese, it comes at the end, sort of like the name ender <ja>さん</ja>, <ja>ちゃん</ja>, and so on. You can add <ja>山</ja> to the end of any mountain's name too, not just Mount Fuji.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Normally <ja>ふじ</ja> would be in kanji, but I wanted you to see this kanji use in action since it's more useful than just being used on Mount Fuji. This is treated like a jukugo word (combo kanji word). In the case of jukugo, usually the on'yomi reading is used, meaning you just have to remember the on'yomi reading of <ja>山</ja>. Luckily, you learned this when you were learning the kanji, so you should already know it! ",
