This is the most respectful bow you can possibly do. (Thank you China, for bringing this word into Japanese and thank you Japanese for bringing this into English.)",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <ja>頭</ja> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nThey used to make you <vocabulary>kowtow</vocabulary> every single time you came to <ja><reading>とう</reading>きょう</ja>. That's full on head to floor kowtowing in front of everyone who is already in <ja>とうきょう</ja> to prove that you appreciate being there. They might even make you do it these days too, if you're not being respectful enough while you're there.",
