  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nRa, the Egyptian god asks you: \"Can you do it? Are you <vocabulary>certain</vocabulary> you can build the pyramids?\" \n\n\"Yes I <reading>can ra</reading> (<ja>かなら</ja>). Yes I can,\" you reply.",
