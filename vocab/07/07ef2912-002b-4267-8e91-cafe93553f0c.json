  "sourceMnemonic": "The kanji means <kanji>strangle</kanji> and this vocab is the verb version of that: <vocabulary>to strangle</vocabulary>. t’s usually used in the phrase <ja>首を絞める</ja>, which also means “to strangle.” \n\nThere is another word, <ja>絞る</ja> which means \"to wring out\" that looks very similar. You know that this one is \"to strangle\" because it has <ja>める</ja> sticking out of it. Imagine that in the <reading>mail</reading> (<ja>める</ja>) you get a letter that says \"I'm going <vocabulary>to strangle</vocabulary> you!\" When you get this in the mail, you know it's about strangling.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The thing that is threatening <vocabulary>to strangle</vocabulary> you is actually a <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>)! The sheep comes to your house and says, \"here's the sheep mail!\" and then tries to strangle you. It puts its hard feet on your neck though it's pretty ineffective.\n\n",
