  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nThis is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. The kanji means <kanji>above</kanji> so this means something rises. For example: A fever goes up. The sun rises. See? No direct object here. That's why this verb means <vocabulary>to rise</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to go up</vocabulary>.\n\nBe careful not to confuse this with its transitive buddy <ja>上げる</ja>, which means \"to lift something\" or \"to raise something.\" With that other verb, someone is doing the lifting, it's not happening by itself like it is here.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you can guess that it uses the kun'yomi reading, which also happens to be a reading you didn't learn when you learned the kanji. Let's use a mnemonic for the kun'yomi reading now, though. You have to remember at least the <ja>あ</ja> part to read it.\n\nYou know that this word means <vocabulary>to go up</vocabulary>. Imagine something just rising on its own, like a floating tree or something. What would you say? Probably a \"surprised\" sound. Maybe you'd scream \"<ja><reading>あ</reading></ja>!\" when you saw this floating tree.\n\nIf you need help remembering the hiragana part, imagine that it's a girl rising up and you scream \"<reading>Ah! Girl!</reading>\"(<ja>あがる</ja>).",
