  "sourceMnemonic": "You hopefully know the word <ja>返す</ja>, which means \"to return\" (as in, you're doing the direct action of returning something). This word, on the other hand, is the version where something just returns (and you're not doing the action of returning it). Use the <ja>る</ja> to help you to remember this. <ja>る</ja> the Kangaroo is returned to you. You don't do any of the returning, it just happens or someone else does it. That's why this word means <vocabulary>to be returned</vocabulary>.\n\nNote this word is often combined with <ja>くる</ja> (to come), which reinforces the aspect that something is coming back to you.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as <ja>返す</ja>, so as long as you know that you'll be able to apply it here to learn the reading of this word as well.",
