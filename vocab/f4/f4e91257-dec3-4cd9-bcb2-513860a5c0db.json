  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're thrown into something <vocabulary>dark</vocabulary> and small. A lid is closed on top of you, and you are confused. What have you been thrown in? You find out you've been thrown in a <reading>cooler</reading> (<ja>くら</ja>). Feel afraid like you would be if you were thrown in such a dark cooler like this. Is it cold?",
