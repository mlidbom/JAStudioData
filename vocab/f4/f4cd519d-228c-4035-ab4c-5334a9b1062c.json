  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. However, the first kanji <ja>寝</ja> actually uses its kun'yomi <ja>ね</ja>. <ja>不足</ja> is on'yomi as you'd expect, but the <ja>ふ</ja> in <ja>不</ja> changes to <ja>ぶ</ja>, so hopefully you've been getting enough sleep.",
