  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an <ja>い</ja> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>bad</kanji>? It's also <vocabulary>bad</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nDo you know how in the Mario universe all the <vocabulary>bad</vocabulary> versions are called \"<reading>WARU</reading>\" (<ja>わる</ja>)? For example: \"WARUIJI\" and \"WARIO.\" That's because they are bad. They come from this kanji. So, if you ever need to remember this reading, just think back to Wario and Waruigi.",
