  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!\n\nThis word can also be read <ja>つるぎ</ja>, but in that case its meaning is limited to Western-style swords only. Because of the meaning difference, we only accept the <ja>けん</ja> reading (but you'll get another try if you enter <ja>つるぎ</ja>).",
