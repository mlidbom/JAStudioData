  "sourceMnemonic": "Something is a trouble (<ja>面倒</ja>) and it is smelly (<ja>臭い</ja>). So what is something that's smelly and a trouble? Well, something that's <vocabulary>troublesome</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>a bother</vocabulary>, I suppose. Basically you can ignore the smelly part. For some reason someone threw that back in, but smelly things are a bother, I suppose.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the words <ja>面倒</ja> plus <ja>臭い</ja> added together. Just make sure you know those words and you'll know this one too!",
