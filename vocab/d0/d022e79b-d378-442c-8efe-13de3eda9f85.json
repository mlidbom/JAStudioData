  "sourceMnemonic": "This is similar to <ja>育つ</ja>, except now you're doing the raising of someone. This word means <vocabulary>to bring up</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to raise</vocabulary>. You can remember this because of the <ja>てる</ja>. Your version of bringing a child up involves <reading>tear</reading>ing (<ja>てる</ja>) all their clothes to make them look poor so they can get the cheaper lunch at school. You're rich because of all the tax breaks you get from all the children you're raising, but you could always use more money to fuel your StarCraft addiction (we've all been there).",
