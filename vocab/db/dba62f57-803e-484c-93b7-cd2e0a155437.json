  "sourceMnemonic": "Remember how you learned <ja>捕まる</ja> is \"to be caught.\" Well this is the transitive version, so it means <vocabulary>to catch</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to capture</vocabulary>. You (or someone else) is doing the catching, which is better than being the one who gets caught, I suppose.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is also not the same as <ja>捕まる</ja>. Sorry! It does have a similar reading to <ja>取る</ja> though, which also has to do with grabbing things (like grabbing onto an idea, for example). You can use <ja>取る</ja> as a jumping off point for remembering the reading of this word. You might also find it useful to think back to <ja>捉える</ja>, which has to do with mentally \"catching\" or \"grasping\" things. You'll sometimes see this written as <ja>捕らえる</ja> as well.",
