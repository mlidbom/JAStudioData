  "sourceMnemonic": "You see the kanji for <kanji>rain</kanji> being followed by the 天 kanji from 天気 (weather). This word means <vocabulary>rainy weather</vocabulary>.\n\nThis has a formal nuance to it, and is often used for event announcements (whether to postpone it in case of rainy weather, etc).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, so you use on'yomi readings. You should be familiar with the on'yomi reading for 天 already, but not for 雨. So here's a mnemonic to help you remember:\n\nThe <vocabulary>rainy weather</vocabulary> won't stop you to go catch some <reading>u</reading>ni (う). You would get wet anyway diving into the ocean to collect uni, the rainy weather doesn't affect you. You can also sell them for <reading>ten</reading> (てん) bucks a piece! The rainy weather isn't at all a problem for a uni hunting if you're making ten dollars for each, you know?",
