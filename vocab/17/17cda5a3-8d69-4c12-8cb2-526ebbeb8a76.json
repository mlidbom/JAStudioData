  "sourceMnemonic": "You've seen <ja>美味しい</ja> by this point. This is the opposite of that. Instead of <ja>美</ja> you have <ja>不</ja> (not), so something that does <kanji>not</kanji> have <kanji>flavor</kanji> is something that doesn't taste good. i.e. something <vocabulary>bad tasting</vocabulary>. This can also refer to someone who's <vocabulary>unskillful</vocabulary> at something as well.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading doesn't follow any of the rules you've run into. It's <ja>まずい</ja>. Think about how you're going through this really long <reading>maze</reading> (<ja>まず</ja>) and how you're promised a really tasty wonderful treat at the end for getting through it (you're a lab rat or something). When you get to the end, there's your treat! What joy! You eat it and... oh man... it is so <vocabulary>bad tasting</vocabulary> you can't even believe it. Be sure to imagine the terrible taste and the terrible disappointment after going through that difficult maze only to get this... this... terribly <vocabulary>unappetizing</vocabulary> cheese.",
