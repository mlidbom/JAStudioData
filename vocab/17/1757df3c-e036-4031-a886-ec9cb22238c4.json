  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>above</kanji> and this verb is related to that meaning. It means <vocabulary>to lift something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to raise something</vocabulary>. It's a transitive verb, meaning that you do something to something else. You raise something. Like your hands!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to use the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou want <vocabulary>to lift something</vocabulary>, and that something is <reading>a</reading>ardvark (<ja>あ</ja>) above your head. Why? Because even though aardvarks have long tongues, they can't reach the ants in the trees. But when you raise this aardvark it can get at those yummy ants!",
