  "sourceMnemonic": "This vocab word has the same meaning as its parent kanji (single alone kanji usually do that!), meaning it means <vocabulary>four</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "When a vocab is alone like this with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually uses its kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception, though, and use the on'yomi reading. However, four and seven actually use both. We're going to go with the kun'yomi reading here, and since you haven't learned this reading yet, here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou have to count to <vocabulary>four</vocabulary>. But you're tired. One... two... three... *<reading>YAWN</reading>* ... four. There, you did it. But *yawn* now you can't stop yawning. You're so, so sleepy. Four is too high a number to count without falling asleep.\n\nBy the way! Both the reading <ja>よん</ja> and <ja>し</ja> are pretty common, but because the on'yomi reading <ja>し</ja> sounds just like the word for \"death,\" it isn't used as much. Generally when you're just counting (for example, \"1, 2, 3, 4...\"), you will use the reading <ja>し</ja>. But when you are counting things or people, you'll use <ja>よん</ja>. There are exceptions to this, but you'll learn them as they come up.",
