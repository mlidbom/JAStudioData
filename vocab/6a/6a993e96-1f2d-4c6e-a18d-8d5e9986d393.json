If you want to understand what something is trying to <kanji>express</kanji> you usually look at its <vocabulary>front</vocabulary> or its <vocabulary>exterior</vocabulary>. This word is usually used for the exterior face of buildings.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet though, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou're standing in front of a building, staring at its <vocabulary>front</vocabulary>. You spend some time gazing at it before you realize what it is. \"<reading>Oh</reading>, <reading>motel</reading> (<ja>おもて</ja>)\", you say aloud. A little time looking at the <vocabulary>exterior</vocabulary> and you're able to figure it out.",
