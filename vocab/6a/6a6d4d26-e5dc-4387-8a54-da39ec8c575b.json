  "sourceMnemonic": "Things that are <kanji>beautiful</kanji> and <kanji>lovely</kanji> are very <vocabulary>beautiful</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>pretty</vocabulary>, and often <vocabulary>clean</vocabulary>, too. You can call someone <ja>綺麗</ja>. You can also mention how clean something is with <ja>綺麗</ja>. Gives you some insight as to what \"beauty\" is in Japan, I suppose. Take your baths, folks.\n\nWondering what the difference is between <ja>綺麗</ja> and <ja>美しい</ja>? <ja>美しい</ja> is more dramatic, so it implies you’re really blown away by something’s (or someone’s) beauty. <ja>綺麗</ja>, on the other hand, is a more everyday word that covers anything that’s beautiful, pretty, or even just clean. In other words, the bar is a bit lower for <ja>綺麗</ja>!",
