  "sourceMnemonic": "The kanji part of this word is like saying \"the <kanji>doing</kanji> <kanji>way</kanji>\" ... aka the way you do something. So, when you don't have a way to do something, there's nothing you can do. Thus is born the popular Japanese phrase: <ja>仕方がない</ja>, which means <vocabulary>can't be helped</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>it's no use</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>there's no other way</vocabulary>. This is a very good expression to know if you're in Japan.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "You already know how to read this from having learned <ja>仕方</ja>, so you should be good to go!",
