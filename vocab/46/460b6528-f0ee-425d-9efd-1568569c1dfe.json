  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This word uses the on'yomi of <ja>自</ja>, which you learned with the kanji, and the kun'yomi of <ja>撮</ja>, which you learned with the word <ja>撮る</ja>. Though it's a bit of an unusual combo, you can probably guess the first one since it's such a common reading, and the second one because of the <ja>り</ja> on the end. Just watch out for rendaku, which turns <ja>とり</ja> into <ja>どり</ja>.",
