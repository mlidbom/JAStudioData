  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Someone is telling you <vocabulary>to move</vocabulary>. They are saying \"<reading>you go</reading> (<ja>うご</ja>) over there. Move! Move!\" If it helps, have them pronounce \"You go\" more like \"Ugo.\"",
