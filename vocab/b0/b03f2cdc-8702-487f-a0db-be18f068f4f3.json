  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an <ja>い</ja> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>warm</kanji>? It's <vocabulary>warm</vocabulary> as well! Though this is for a <vocabulary>warm</vocabulary> weather or temperature, not some warm food or something like that, that would be <ja>温かい</ja>, a different <ja>あたたかい</ja>. Confusing, right?",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the same like <ja>温かい</ja>, which also means <vocabulary>warm</vocabulary>, though it refers to a warm thing unlike <ja>暖かい</ja> which refers to a warm temperature or place.\n\n*Note that <ja>あったかい </ja> is for spoken Japanese. The \"correct\" reading is still <ja>あたたかい</ja>. But we've added this reading too for you chattygattors out there.",
