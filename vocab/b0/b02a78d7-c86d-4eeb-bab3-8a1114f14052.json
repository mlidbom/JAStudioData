  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>congeal</kanji> or <kanji>freeze</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to grow stiff</vocabulary>. But it's also used to mean what happens when your emotions or interests freeze on one thing. You start <vocabulary>to be absorbed in</vocabulary> whatever that thing is. Try to remember both meanings.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nWhat have all your friends started <vocabulary>to be absorbed in</vocabulary>? Their <ja><reading>子</reading></ja>s (<ja>こ</ja>). They all keep having kids and now that's all they seem to care about. Damn kids.",
