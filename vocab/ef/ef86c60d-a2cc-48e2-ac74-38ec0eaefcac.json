  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is a bit weird in this one. It uses the kun'yomi reading for both kanji, even though it looks just like it should be all on'yomi reading. It's like you're taking a <vocabulary>shortcut</vocabulary> with your kanji readings and doing the native Japanese readings (kun'yomi) instead of the more intellectual Chinese ones (on'yomi). Luckily, you've hopefully seen both of these kanji as vocab already. You have <ja>ちか</ja> for <ja>近</ja> (short for <ja>近い</ja>) and you have <ja>道</ja> (<ja>みち</ja>), just like the word \"street\" you learned before. Combine these together and you have the reading for this word. Perhaps it's like this because you're combining a couple concepts together into one word, at least when it comes to \"short + way.\"",
