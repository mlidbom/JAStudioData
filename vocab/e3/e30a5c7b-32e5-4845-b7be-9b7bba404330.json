  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: What is most <vocabulary>valuable</vocabulary> to you? Of course it's your <reading>toe toe</reading> (<ja>とうと</ja>). It's your big toe (the long <ja>とう</ja>) with another small toe growing out of it (short <ja>と</ja>). Imagine your toe toe, and then imagine how valuable it is to you. So valuable! You can also think about <ja>尊い</ja>, a similar word which means \"revered.\" It's a similar idea, and it has the same reading.",
