  "sourceMnemonic": "You've seen that <ja>消す</ja> is \"to extinguish.\" So, this is another verb version of that. This time, you're not doing the extinguishing, it's just happening. Something is going <vocabulary>to disappear</vocabulary> on its own. How can you differentiate this from <ja>消す</ja>? Well, <ja>える</ja> allows you to notice how the object disappeared into thin <reading>air</reading> (<ja>える</ja>). You know you didn't do it, so it disappeared on its own, making it <vocabulary>to disappear</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is different from <ja>消す</ja>, unfortunately, so you can't use that. Just think about how after the object in front of you disappears you use a <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>) to open an invisible door. That's where everything's disappearing to! You see all your disappeared stuff on the other side of this invisible door which you opened with a magical <reading>key</reading>.",
