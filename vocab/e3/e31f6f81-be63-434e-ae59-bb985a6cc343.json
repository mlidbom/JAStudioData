  "sourceMnemonic": "Imagine someone <kanji>accept</kanji>ing something and then <kanji>attach</kanji>ing something. This person is a <vocabulary>receptionist</vocabulary>, because they are accepting the call, writing down the information, and then attaching said information to a sticky note for you to read. You say, \"No, I'm not available.\"",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "For this reading you have to think back to the verb words that get used with this kanji, namely <ja>受ける</ja> and <ja>付ける</ja>. Then just drop off the <ja>る</ja>s and put them together. <ja>受</ja> becomes <ja>うけ</ja> and <ja>付</ja> becomes <ja>つけ</ja> and you're left with <ja>うけつけ</ja>. This is what's called a compound word. And now you know it. Nice!",
