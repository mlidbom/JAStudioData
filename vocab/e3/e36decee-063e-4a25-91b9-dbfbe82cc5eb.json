  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <vocabulary>to carve</vocabulary> up the steak, you wish you could use a knife, but you don't have one. Instead, you'll have to use your <reading>keys</reading> (<ja>きざ</ja>) to cut it. Imagine trying to cut up the steak with these keys. It's very difficult.",
