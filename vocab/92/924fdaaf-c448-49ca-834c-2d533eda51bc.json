  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. This is an intransitive verb, so it means <vocabulary>to be cooked</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to be boiled</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to be done cooking</vocabulary>. Also a little cultural note — this word is used for both rice, and other foods in western Japan, while it's only used for rice in eastern Japan.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.\n\nLucky for you, the kanji readings for transitive and intransitive verbs are almost always the same. Once you learn one, you know them both! This reading is the same as <ja>炊く</ja>.",
