  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>ascend</kanji> so the verb vocab version must be <vocabulary>to ascend</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the kun'yomi reading, but it's pretty easy. How do you read all the other \"to climb\" words? <ja><reading>登る</reading></ja> is one example. <ja><reading>上る</reading></ja> is another. They're all <ja>のぼる</ja>, and so is this. Unlike the other climbing words, though, this suggests there's no effort involved. That's why you're \"ascending\" and not climbing, because climbing is a bit of work.",
