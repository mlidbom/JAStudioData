  "sourceMnemonic": "The <kanji>South</kanji> <kanji>mouth</kanji> isn't actually a mouth you find in the south pole or anything, it's an entrance or exit. This is kind of like how <ja>入り口</ja> means entrance (the <ja>口</ja> represents a doorway). You'll see this word a lot in places like train stations or airports. It means both <vocabulary>South exit</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>South entrance</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading for these kanji are both kun'yomi. Probably because it's two words put together (South + Exit) rather than a single word. Also, body parts tend to change words into kun'yomi readings as well. So, you've seen vocab words that give you the kun'yomi reading of both <ja>南</ja> and <ja>口</ja>, right? Now you just need to combine the two vocab readings into one to be able to read this word. Just watch out for the rendaku that changes <ja>くち</ja> to <ja>ぐち</ja>.",
