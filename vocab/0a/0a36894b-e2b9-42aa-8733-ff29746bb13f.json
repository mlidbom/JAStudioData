  "sourceMnemonic": "Remember how <ja>縫う</ja> means \"to sew.\" Well the only way you can see if a pair of jeans has been sewed with your <kanji>eye</kanji> is if you see a <vocabulary>seam</vocabulary>. If your eyes can't spot the <vocabulary>stitch</vocabulary>es, then it probably wasn't sewed at all. Maybe it was superglued together.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a combination of the words <ja>縫う</ja> and <ja>目</ja>. Both use the kun'yomi readings so just change the <ja>う</ja> to <ja>い</ja> and it's easy! You'll also see this word spelled <ja>縫い目</ja> too. They're exactly the same!",
