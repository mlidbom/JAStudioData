  "sourceMnemonic": "You know that <ja>交ぜる</ja> means <vocabulary>to mix</vocabulary> and that the kanji means <kanji>mix</kanji> as well. So, this probably has something to do with mixing things. This word means <vocabulary>to be mixed</vocabulary>. This is when something is mixed but it's not mixed by you. It's just being mixed. Think of it this way - the <ja>じ</ja> in <ja>交じる</ja> is Jesus, who just uses Jesus magic to mix something. So, you're not mixing it. It's just when something is <vocabulary>to be mixed</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as with <ja>交ぜる</ja>. So long as you know the <ja>ま</ja> portion of that word's reading, you'll be able to read this word as well.",
