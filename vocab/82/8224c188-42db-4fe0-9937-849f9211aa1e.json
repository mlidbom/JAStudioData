  "sourceMnemonic": "When you <kanji>attach</kanji> your <kanji>energy</kanji> (imagine someone suddenly looking up at something, attaching their energy to it), you have noticed or realized something. That's why this word means <vocabulary>to realize</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to notice</vocabulary>. \n\nDon't confuse this with <ja>気を付けて</ja> which is similar in that it has all the same kanji. It's just used a little different. Try to remember the difference before moving on.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The readings come from the <ja>気</ja> kanji (which you know) and the word <ja>付く</ja> which you should know by now. Combine these together and you have the ability to read this word. Take note that the <ja>付く</ja> part is rendaku'd, though, so it is a tiny bit different.",
