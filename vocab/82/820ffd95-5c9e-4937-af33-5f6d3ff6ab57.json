That's why this word is <vocabulary>to be erected</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to be built</vocabulary>. You can recognize that because of the <ja>つ</ja>, which tells you that <reading>two</reading> (<ja>つ</ja>) guys are building the building while you watch. So you're not doing it, they are, and it's just happening.",
