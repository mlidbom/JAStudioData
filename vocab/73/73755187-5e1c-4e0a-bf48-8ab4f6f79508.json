So if you know the reading of that word (I hope you do!) then you can apply that knowledge here.\n\nJust a quick side note — <ja>開く</ja> can also be read as <ja>ひらく</ja>, but we're going to focus on the <ja>あく</ja> reading here. Since <ja>ひらく</ja> has slightly different meanings, we won't accept it as a reading for this word, so be sure to enter <ja>あく</ja>!\n",
