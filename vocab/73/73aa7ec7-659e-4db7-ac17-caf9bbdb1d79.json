  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>bow</kanji> or <kanji>lay</kanji>, so the verb version is what when you try <vocabulary>to cover</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to hide</vocabulary> something. You're doing the action to something, you're not the one hiding.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nWho's that you're trying <vocabulary>to cover</vocabulary> up? It's your <reading>foo</reading>l (<ja>ふ</ja>) brother. He keeps doing embarrassing things and trying to get you in trouble. So you're trying <vocabulary>to hide</vocabulary> him with your jacket. Well we see him, we know he's a fool, so you can stop now.",
