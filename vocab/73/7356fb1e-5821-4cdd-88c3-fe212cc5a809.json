  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf you're too shy <vocabulary>to approach</vocabulary> people just learn how to use a <reading>yo</reading>-yo (<ja>よ</ja>)! Then people will approach you to compliment you on your sick skills. You won't have to do it yourself!",
