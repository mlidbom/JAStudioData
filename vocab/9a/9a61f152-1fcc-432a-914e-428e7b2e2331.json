  "sourceMnemonic": "The <kanji>heaven</kanji> <kanji>king</kanji> <kanji>star</kanji> is the planet <vocabulary>Uranus</vocabulary>. Knowledge of Greek mythology will definitely help you here, because the English name is a reference to the Greek god of the skies, and the Japanese name is a direct translation of that!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word and uses the on'yomi, but over time the reading for <ja>王</ja> changed from <ja>おう</ja> to <ja>のう</ja>, to make it easier to pronounce. You'll still see that listed as an alternative reading in some dictionaries, but it's pretty much never used nowadays, so we'll only accept the <ja>てんのうせい</ja> reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember:\n\nWho predicted the discovery of <vocabulary>Uranus</vocabulary>? <reading>No</reading>stradamus (<ja>のう</ja>), of course!",
