  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You sort of did learn this reading with the vocabulary word <ja>煙</ja>, but this one is just different enough where we thought we should make a mnemonic for this one: \n\nAll this <vocabulary>smoki</vocabulary>ness is from a terrible <reading>chem</reading>ical (<ja>けむ</ja>) spill that happened nearby. It was acid, so it burned everything up real good, causing the air to get pretty smoky.",
