  "sourceMnemonic": "<ja>月</ja> in Japanese means \"moon\" but it also means \"month.\" Why? Probably because the moon takes about a month to get through its cycles. So, what's the fourth moon of the year? Here's a hint, it's the same as the fourth month of the year: <vocabulary>April</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. <ja>月</ja> has two on'yomi readings, but it always uses the <ja>がつ</ja> reading in the names of the months, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember that:\n\nIn <vocabulary>April</vocabulary>, you habitually eat <reading>shee</reading>p <reading>guts</reading> (<ja>しがつ</ja>). It's a tradition you started many years ago, and now you just can't stop eating sheep guts every April. Delicious!",
