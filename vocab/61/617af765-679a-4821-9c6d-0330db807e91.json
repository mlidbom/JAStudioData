Put them together and you have <ja>はなち</ja>, though you want to change the <ja>ち</ja> to <ja>ぢ</ja>. Alternatively, it's possible (though less common, but it doesn't matter if you're turning it to kanji via an IME anyways) to write it as <ja>はなじ</ja>. I guess that blood added a little tenten (it represents the blood coming out of that nose!). Spurt spurt spurt.",
