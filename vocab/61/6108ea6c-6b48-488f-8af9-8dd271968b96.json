You can also say it's <vocabulary>scarlet red</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>blood</vocabulary> as well, though more in a poetic sense, I'd say. I don't think you'll hear surgeons calling blood <ja>朱</ja>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading <ja>あけ</ja> is like the beginning of <ja>開ける</ja>, which means \"to open.\" Just imagine you're opening (<ja>あけ</ja>) a person up, and out gushes a <vocabulary>vermilion</vocabulary> colored <vocabulary>blood</vocabulary>. You shouldn't open people up like that.",
