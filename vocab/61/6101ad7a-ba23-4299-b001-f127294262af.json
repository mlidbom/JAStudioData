  "sourceMnemonic": "The kanji and the word share the meaning of <vocabulary>swamp</vocabulary>, but this word is primarily used to mean <vocabulary>mountain stream</vocabulary>. Think of it this way, the water for a swamp has to come from somewhere right? It starts out up in the mountains and drains out into a swamp in the valley. The life cycle of a mountain stream into a swamp!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: The beginning of the word <vocabulary>swamp</vocabulary> is actually pretty similar to this word's reading. <ja>さわ</ja> = \"swa\"? I'd say it's close enough to make a mnemonic out of in your head.",
