  "sourceMnemonic": "A <kanji>person</kanji>'s <kanji>hometown</kanji> is a <vocabulary>human habitation</vocabulary>, or a <vocabulary>village</vocabulary>. This word has a slightly old-fashioned feel, and it's usually used for small villages in the countryside.\n\nIt's often combined with <ja>はなれた</ja> (separated) to talk about how far away from the nearest human habitation something is.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This jukugo uses the kun'yomi of the kanji instead of the more usual on'yomi. You learned both of these readings when you learned the vocabulary <ja>人</ja> and <ja>里</ja>. Just notice that <ja>さと</ja> becomes <ja>ざと</ja>, because of rendaku.",
