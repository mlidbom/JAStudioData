  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>fix</kanji> so this vocab word means <vocabulary>to fix</vocabulary>. This is when you're fixing something, as in doing the actual physical action of fixing.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have to learn the <ja>なお</ja> part. Think of it this way. You need <vocabulary>to fix</vocabulary> something! It's urgent! You have to fix it <reading>now</reading>! (<ja>なお</ja>). This will also work with the similar word, <ja>直る</ja>, which you'll learn soon if you haven't already.",
