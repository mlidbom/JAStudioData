  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nThis is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. The kanji means <kanji>cut</kanji> so this generally means that something is cut. Something breaks or snaps. No direct object here. That's why this verb means <vocabulary>to be cut</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to snap</vocabulary>. Another meaning of this verb is <vocabulary>to expire</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to run out</vocabulary>. This could be various things like your passport, or a deadline for an assignment.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. Here's a refresher to help you remember the  <ja>き</ja> portion of this word: \n\nSomething is <vocabulary>snap</vocabulary>ping. Turns out that something is your arm. Your arm is a <ja><reading>木</reading></ja> (<ja>き</ja>) that grew out of you one day. \"What's this ki doing here?\" you ask. Then it suddenly <vocabulary>break</vocabulary>s in half! \"OW OW OW! My ki! It's been cut!!\"",
