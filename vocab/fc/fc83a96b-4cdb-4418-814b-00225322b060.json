  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Hide your <reading>cock</reading> (<ja>かく</ja>)! You have a ton of roosters but you don't want people to know about them, so you gotta hide your cocks. What did you think I was talking about?",
