You need to use the kun'yomi readings to read this word. You already know the kun'yomi reading for <ja>三</ja> from when you learned the word <ja>三つ</ja>. Here is a way to remember the reading for <ja>日</ja>:\n\nOn the <vocabulary>third day</vocabulary> you have to give <reading>me</reading> (<ja>み</ja>) a ride in your <reading>car</reading> (<ja>か</ja>). I don't have a car of my own, so don't forget me, okay?",
