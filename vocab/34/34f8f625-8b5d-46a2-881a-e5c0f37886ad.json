  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>struggle</kanji> so the verb version is <vocabulary>to struggle</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to fight</vocabulary>. This struggle is fairly figurative, too. It's more like \"the struggle against terrorism\" or \"the fight against drugs.\" Not so much a fight with people, which would be <ja>戦う</ja>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Your neighborhood is fighting a struggle against car theft. Sadly, your car was stolen. So, you say: \"<reading>ta ta, ca</reading>r (<ja>たたか</ja>). Ta ta.\"",
