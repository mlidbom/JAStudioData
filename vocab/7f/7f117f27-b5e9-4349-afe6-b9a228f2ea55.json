  "sourceMnemonic": "Remember how <ja>増える</ja> is \"to increase\" (as in, something just increases, you aren't doing the increasing yourself). This one is that one, where you're doing the increasing. So, this word means <vocabulary>to increase something</vocabulary>. You know you're doing the increasing because you said \"yes\" (<ja>やす</ja>) to increasing something, and did it yourself.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the same like <ja>増える</ja>. If you know that vocab word you probably can read this one as well.",
