  "sourceMnemonic": "Because this word ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you can tell it's probably a verb. The kanji portion means <vocabulary>near</vocabulary>. The verb version of that is <vocabulary>to draw near</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to get close</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to approach</vocabulary>. Essentially, the general idea is that you're getting closer to something. You're becoming more nearby. You're approaching.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "There's hiragana attached to this kanji, which means it's probably the kun'yomi reading (and it is). You've seen the kun'yomi reading via the word <ja>近い</ja>. So, as long as you know that word, you should be able to read this one as well.",
