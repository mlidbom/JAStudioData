Also, the <ja>年</ja> is the kun'yomi reading for some reason. It's a total mystery why this is. Perhaps the ancient aliens know, but I do not. You're going to have to remember this exception with that brain of yours and rely on the SRS to bestow this knowledge upon you.\n\nThe second reading, which is less common but still common enough, makes more sense. It is <ja>こんねん</ja> and just follows the jukugo patterns.",
