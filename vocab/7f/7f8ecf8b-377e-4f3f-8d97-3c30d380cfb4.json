This can also refer to the person doing the action, so it can sometimes mean <vocabulary>sightseer</vocabulary> too.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is all on'yomi, and you know how to read <ja>物</ja>. <ja>見</ja>'s on'yomi (<ja>けん</ja>) is a reading you didn't learn with the kanji because it's so much less useful, but you do have to know it here. You've seen it with <ja>発見</ja> a couple levels ago, so that should help. Just imagine taking the samurai <reading>Ken</reading> on an epic <vocabulary>sightseeing</vocabulary> trip. Think of all the things you and Ken will visit!",
