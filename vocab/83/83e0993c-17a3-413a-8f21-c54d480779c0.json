  "sourceMnemonic": "The <ja>さん</ja> on the end is the name honorific <ja>さん</ja>. It's there to show some respect. It's like saying \"Mr. Guest!\" or something like that. But that sounds dumb in English. We'll just call this word <vocabulary>guest</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>visitor</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>customer</vocabulary>. You'll hear this word a lot when you're at a store or you're a customer somewhere in Japan. You are the <ja>お客さん</ja>, in that situation. Alternatively, you'll also hear <ja>お客さま</ja> which is a more polite version of this word (because it ends in <ja>さま</ja> and not <ja>さん</ja>).",
