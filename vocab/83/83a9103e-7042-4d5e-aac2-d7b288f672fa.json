  "sourceMnemonic": "The kanji <ja>達</ja> pluralizes things sometimes. So, when you have a <kanji>plural</kanji> amount of a <kanji>person</kanji> you have more than one person, you have <vocabulary>people</vocabulary>.\n\nTake note! When using this word, you want to attach it to the type of \"people\" you are talking about. For example, <ja>あの人達</ja> (those people over there). Other examples: <ja>男の人達</ja>, <ja>その人達</ja>, <ja>向こうの人達</ja>, etc. You don't use this by itself, instead you use it with something describing what kind of people you're talking about.",
