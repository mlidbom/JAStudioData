  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nThe kanji <ja>受</ja> means <kanji>accept</kanji> and this verb is related. It means <vocabulary>to get accepted</vocabulary>, usually into something good like a university or a new job. It can also mean <vocabulary>to succeed</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to pass</vocabulary>, often in the context of a test or an exam. \n\nThis is an intransitive verb, meaning it happens on its own. The <ja>かる</ja> ending is a hint, because verbs with <ja>かる</ja> as okurigana (kana added to the kanji) are usually intransitive.\n\nWatch out: whereas in English we'd say \"to pass an exam\", in Japanese it's <ja>試験に受かる</ja>, or \"to pass in an exam\". That's why it's intransitive in Japanese, even though we might make it transitive in the English translation!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. Here's a little mnemonic to help ya remember:\n\nYou open up your acceptance letter and shout \"OOOO!!!\" (<ja>う</ja>). You passed!\n",
