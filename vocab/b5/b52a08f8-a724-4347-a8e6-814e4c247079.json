  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>lack</kanji>, and this verb has several meanings related to that. It can mean <vocabulary>to be lacking</vocabulary>, like \"imagination is really lacking in this movie.\" It can also mean <vocabulary>to not be present</vocabulary>, like when you realize your Japanese teacher is missing. When talking about something like a tea cup or your teeth, it can mean <vocabulary>to get chipped</vocabulary>. I guess if you chip a teapot it is lacking in...perfection?",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nSomething is lacking... it's a <reading>ca</reading>r (<ja>か</ja>). You can't stop thinking about this because you have to walk 40 miles to get to your destination. If only that car wasn't missing, this would be easier. Imagine the sweat... the pain... the thirst... all because that car's not present.",
