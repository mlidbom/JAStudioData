The <ja>る</ja> in <ja>作る</ja> gets changed to <ja>り</ja> because it's an adjective, and the <ja>つ</ja> in <ja>つくり</ja> gets changed to <ja>づ</ja> because of the way the words are combined with each other. You should know most of the reading that is in this word, though it will probably take a little bit of thinking to sort out the little changes in those readings.",
