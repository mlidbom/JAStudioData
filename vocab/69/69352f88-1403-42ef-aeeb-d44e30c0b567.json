  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>walk</kanji> so the verb version means <vocabulary>to walk</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have to remember the <ja>ある</ja> portion. Imagine yourself going <vocabulary>to walk</vocabulary> outside. But, as you walk, you walk like a pirate. You have a peg leg, a parrot, and a hook. Lastly, you say \"<reading>arrrrr</reading>\" (<ja>ある</ja>). Go ahead, say it out loud while walking around your room like a pirate. It will help.",
