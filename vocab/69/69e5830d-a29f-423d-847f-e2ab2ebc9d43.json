  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nIf you <kanji>obtain</kanji> something, you'll want it <vocabulary>to fit inside</vocabulary> your bag. Otherwise how can you take it home? Depending on the context, this verb can also mean <vocabulary>to settle down</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to be finished</vocabulary>. \n\nLike most verbs with <ja>まる</ja> as okurigana, this is an intransitive verb. That means it happens by itself, with no emphasis on the person or thing that's making something fit inside, or settle down.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou don't fit inside your bed anymore. I guess you've grown? Better get out the trusty <reading>o</reading>ld <reading>saw</reading>s (<ja>おさ</ja>) and chop off your footboard. ",
