  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>transmit</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to transmit</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to tell</vocabulary> something.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou want <vocabulary>to transmit</vocabulary> a signal to the <reading>sta</reading>rs (<ja>つた</ja>)! Trying <vocabulary>to tell</vocabulary> your message to anyone on earth would be too boring and too easy. Aim your message at the nearest star and transmit it into space!",
