  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>review</kanji>. What do you do when you review something? You look back on it. Meaning <vocabulary>to look back on something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to reflect on something</vocabulary>. This can also mean <vocabulary>to be attentive to someone</vocabulary>, for example your family.\n\nThis is a transitive verb, meaning it takes a direct object. You look back on the past, you reflect on the consequences of your actions, and you're attentive to your family.",
