  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>go beyond</kanji> so the verb vocab version is also <vocabulary>to go beyond</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is very similar in meaning to <ja>越える</ja>. Both can refer to overcoming some physical object or passing beyond a certain amount of time. However, <ja>越す</ja> tends to sound a little less intense, while <ja>越える</ja> really focuses on the physical or emotional challenge of overcoming a certain milestone. For example, while <ja>山を越す</ja> simply refers to crossing a mountain, <ja>山を越える</ja> gives the impression that crossing the mountain is a difficulty you've overcome.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as <ja>越える</ja>. So if you know that you know this too! In case you need a reminder, here's the mnemonic:\n\n<vocabulary>To go beyond</vocabulary> <reading>child</reading> (<ja>こ</ja>) years in order to become an adult, you have to be 18 years old in the USA, and 20 years old in Japan.",
