  "sourceMnemonic": "This word has a single kanji with hiragana attached, ending in a <ja>い</ja>. This means you know it's an adjective. What is the adjective form of <kanji>few</kanji>? It's also <vocabulary>few</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading for this one is fairly difficult, as it's the kun'yomi reading (you can tell it's kun'yomi because of all the hiragana attached). You have to remember the <ja>すく</ja> part to remember the reading of this word. Think of it this way: \n\nYou have a <vocabulary>few</vocabulary> of something. This something is <reading>suck</reading>ers (<ja>すく</ja>). Imagine putting all (three-ish) of them in your mouth at once. How does it taste? Can you taste the flavors from each of the few?",
