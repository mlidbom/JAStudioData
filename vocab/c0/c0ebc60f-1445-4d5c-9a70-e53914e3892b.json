  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>renew</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to be renewed</vocabulary>. Like most verbs ending in <ja>まる</ja>, this is an intransitive verb, meaning it happens all on its own. Nobody is doing the renewing, it's just happening (as renewing often does).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You probably learned this reading with this verb's transitive other half <ja>改める</ja>, but here's a mnemonic anyway just in case: \n\n<vocabulary>To be renewed</vocabulary> you decide to go to a spa. You get in a bathtub and they pour in <reading>a lotta</reading> (<ja>あらた</ja>) leeches and eels to help you to be renewed. Feel the fear. There are a lot of them! Alternatively, you can imagine them pouring in a lotta Maru cats, because that's way fuzzier.",
