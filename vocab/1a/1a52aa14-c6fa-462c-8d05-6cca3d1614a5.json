One thing you'll notice with Japanese and kanji is that <ja>何</ja>, when added to other things, often means \"how many _____\" rather than \"what ____.\" Just something you have to know and experience a bit to catch on to, but you will, I believe in you. So, for this one it's <vocabulary>how many times</vocabulary>.",
