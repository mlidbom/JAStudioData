The kanji itself means <kanji>surplus</kanji> so the verb version would be <vocabulary>to be in surplus</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to remain left over</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to be in excess</vocabulary>. Too much!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \"I have a surplus of kittens from that last batch we made, Reddit. <reading>AMA</reading> (ask me anything, <ja>あま</ja>).\"",
