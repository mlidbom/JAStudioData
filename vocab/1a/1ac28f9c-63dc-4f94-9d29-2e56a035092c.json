  "sourceMnemonic": "Something that is double <kanji>weak</kanji> is probably pretty weak. You also know that this is an adjective because it ends with <ja>い</ja>. You know that <ja>弱い</ja> is weak, so it probably isn't that. Instead, this one is <vocabulary>weak looking</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>frail</vocabulary>. If you know the grammar <ja>らしい</ja> you can kind of use that as a hint. The <ja>しい</ja> on the end reminds me of <ja>らしい</ja> which is like \"seems to be.\" So, \"seems to be weak\" = \"weak looking.\"",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is double kun'yomi, as you can probably guess due to all the hiragana involved. So, you double up on <ja>よわ</ja> and then add the <ja>しい</ja> to read this vocabulary word.",
