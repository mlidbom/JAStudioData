  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>begin</kanji> or <kanji>start</kanji>, and the verb version is <vocabulary>to begin</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to begin something</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to start</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to start something</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. You start something. Like studying! You should have started studying earlier though, huh?",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nRight now it's time <vocabulary>to begin</vocabulary> <reading>Haj</reading> (<ja>はじ</ja>). (Haj is the fifth pillar of Islam, and is a pilgrimage to Mecca during the month of Dhu al-Hijja). You need to start Haj right now!",
