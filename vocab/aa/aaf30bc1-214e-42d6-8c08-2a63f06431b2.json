  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji means <kanji>dilute</kanji>, and this is an intransitive verb, as you can guess from the <ja>まる</ja> ending. So this verb means <vocabulary>to be diluted</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to be diminished</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to become weak</vocabulary>. ",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.\n\nThe reading comes from <ja>薄い</ja>, so if you know that you'll be able to read this too. If not, here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou don't want your drink <vocabulary>to be diluted</vocabulary>, so <reading>you sue</reading> (<ja>うす</ja>) anyone who dares pour you a weak drink.",
