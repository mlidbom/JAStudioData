  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is pretty weird, but then again so are people from Osaka (just kidding, Osakazens!). The <ja>大</ja> reads like <ja>おお</ja> from <ja>おおきい</ja>. Then, <ja>阪</ja> uses the kun'yomi reading as well, which you didn't learn. That being said, doesn't this kanji look like <ja>坂</ja>, which also means slope? Well, it shares a kun'yomi reading as well, so if you've seen <ja>坂</ja> you can apply that reading over to here, making <ja>おおさか</ja>. Then again, if you know this word means <vocabulary>Osaka</vocabulary> you probably can figure out how to write it too. Don't forget the double <ja>おお</ja> though!",
