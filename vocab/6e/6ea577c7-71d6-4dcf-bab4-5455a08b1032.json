You have <ja>混じる</ja> (to get mixed up in), <ja>混ぜる</ja> (to mix), <ja>混ざる</ja> (to get mixed), and now this: <ja>混む</ja>, <vocabulary>to be crowded</vocabulary>. It makes sense that when everyone's all mixed up it's going to be crowded, but how to differentiate between this and the other <ja>混</ja> words? Just think of how cows <reading>muuuuu</reading> (<ja>む</ja>) get all bunched up and crowded, which is why this word is <vocabulary>to be crowded</vocabulary>.",
