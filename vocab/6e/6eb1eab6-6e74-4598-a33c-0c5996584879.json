  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means both <kanji>music</kanji> and <kanji>bend</kanji>. In the case of this word, we're looking at \"bend.\" So, the verb form of bend is <vocabulary>to be bent</vocabulary>. This is when something bends on its own, not when you're doing the bending. It's just bending.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nSomething, let's say a road, starts out straight. But, with some <reading>ma</reading>gic, a witch causes it <vocabulary>to curve</vocabulary>.",
