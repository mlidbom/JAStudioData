  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: What's that <kanji>figure</kanji> / <kanji>shape</kanji> in the distance? Is that who I think it is? Is that <reading>Sugar To</reading>m (<ja>すがた</ja>)??? You'll have to make up some lore about this \"Sugar Tom\" but whatever you do be excited about him. He's a dude who gives you tons of sugar, I'm guessing, and you always see him coming from a long ways away because of his Sugar Tom hat, or something like that.",
