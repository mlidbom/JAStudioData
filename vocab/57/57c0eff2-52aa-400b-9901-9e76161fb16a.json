  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>entangle</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to be entangled</vocabulary>. This is when something is entangled on its own (you're not directly doing the entangling). You can remember this because of the <ja>む</ja>, which is you saying <reading>mo</reading>ve (<ja>む</ja>) out of the way, I have to take care of this entanglement mess that just happened on its own.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: The entanglement mess you're fixing is a couple of kids that got their hair tangled up. They were doing some sparring in their <ja><reading>から</reading>て</ja> class and one thing led to the other and suddenly both their hair was entangled together.",
