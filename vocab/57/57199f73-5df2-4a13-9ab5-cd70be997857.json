When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\nThis <vocabulary>year</vocabulary> you plan on <reading>tossi</reading>ng (<ja>とし</ja>) out all your old stuff as a New Year's resolution. You pronounce it \"toshing\" though, because it has more vigor that way.",
