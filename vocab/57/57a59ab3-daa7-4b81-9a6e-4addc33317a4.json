  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\nYou visit the <vocabulary>sea</vocabulary>. Strangely, it asks you who is visiting. You're so full of yourself (even in front of the sea/ocean) that you reply: \"<reading>um, me</reading>?\" (<ja>うみ</ja>). Imagine yourself feeling this full of yourself.",
