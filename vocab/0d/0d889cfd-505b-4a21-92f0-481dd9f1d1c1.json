  "sourceMnemonic": "You know that the kanji means <kanji>connection</kanji>. This is a verb, so one meaning is <vocabulary>to be connected</vocabulary>. It can also mean <vocabulary>to be involved</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to be related</vocabulary>. Basically things that have to do with being connected with something else.\n\nDoes this all sound familiar? In fact, this is another way to write <ja>関わる</ja>, which you already learned! The two have exactly the same meaning, but this version is a bit less common.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. It's exactly the same as the reading for <ja>関わる</ja>, so here's a reminder of that mnemonic to help you:\n\nRemember the \"<reading>Kaw Kaw</reading> (<ja>かか</ja>) Crow Gang\"? They are bad news, always eating from garbage and squawking \"kaw kaw\"... You don't want <vocabulary>to be involved</vocabulary> with them.",
