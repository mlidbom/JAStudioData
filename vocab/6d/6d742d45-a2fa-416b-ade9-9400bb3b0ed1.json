  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>retreat</kanji>, and this verb version is when you make something retreat. In other words, it means <vocabulary>to repel something</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to dismiss something</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to reject something</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. You repel something, like bad luck. You reject something, like a proposal.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. You learned this with its intransitive pair verb <ja>退く</ja>, but here's a mnemonic just in case:\n\nRemember the re-zoner? Well, <vocabulary>to repel</vocabulary> bad luck, <reading>she, re-zo</reading>ned (<ja>しりぞ</ja>) the whole place. No bad luck allowed inside the zone.",
