Not to the edge. This was really <vocabulary>half finished</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>half assed</vocabulary> of you.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The <ja>ぱ</ja> at the end is the only tricky part here since that isn't a common reading (or the one you learned before) for the kanji. Just think of your ol' <reading>Pa</reading> (<ja>ぱ</ja>), who is the biggest half-asser you know.\n",
