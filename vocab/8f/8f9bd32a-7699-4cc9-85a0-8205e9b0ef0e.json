  "sourceMnemonic": "Remember how <ja>手</ja> can mean “doer”? Here, we have a <kanji>sell</kanji> <kanji>doer</kanji>. Who might that be? It’s someone who does selling – a <vocabulary>seller</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>vendor</vocabulary>.\n\n<ja>売り手</ja> is usually used when talking about sellers versus buyers.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This word uses the kun'yomi readings for both kanji, but you know them both now, so you should be able to read this too! One hint that this is a kun'yomi reading word is the hiragana in the center. It's like two separate words combined together, and when a word is a single kanji / a single kanji with hiragana attached it is usually kun'yomi. This is like two of those, combined.",
