Lastly, it has <ja>さん</ja> which is an honorific to elevate people and be polite. This is basically the formal way of saying <vocabulary>older brother</vocabulary> (versus plain old <ja>兄</ja>). It can also be used to refer to a <vocabulary>guy</vocabulary> that you don't know who has a youthful appearance. ",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading for this one is pretty tricky, and I'd consider it an exception. To remember it, you have to learn the <ja>兄</ja> part, and everything else will fall into place. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYour (kind) <vocabulary>older brother</vocabulary> pushes you down on the ground. You stand up and look at your <reading>knee</reading> (<ja>にい</ja>), which is all bloody. \"Why'd you do that to my knee!?\" you ask. \"You're supposed to be a nice older brother, that's why I call you <ja>お兄さん</ja>!\"",
