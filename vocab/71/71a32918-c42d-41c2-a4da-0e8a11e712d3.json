  "sourceMnemonic": "<ja>当てる</ja> means \"to guess\" or \"to hit\", and <ja>字</ja> means <kanji>letter</kanji>. So these are guessed letters? Kind of, they're so-called <vocabulary>phonetic kanji</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>ateji</vocabulary>.\n\nThis refers to cases where kanji are used solely for their sound, but not their meaning. There are also some cases of ateji where kanji are used only for their meaning and not their sound, but this is less common. ",
