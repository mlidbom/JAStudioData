  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nWhen a <vocabulary>disaster</vocabulary> strikes, you start moaning and groaning. Say it along with me: \"<reading>Wahhhhh! Zaahhhh! Waahhhh!</reading>\" (<ja>わざわ</ja>). Be careful of the <ja>い</ja> on the end, it can be tricky and make you think it's an adjective when it's a noun.",
