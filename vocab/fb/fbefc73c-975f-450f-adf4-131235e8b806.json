The kanji itself means <kanji>memorize</kanji> so the verb version is <vocabulary>to memorize</vocabulary>. That shouldn't be too hard <vocabulary>to remember</vocabulary>, right?",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use one of the kun'yomi readings. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nThe best way <vocabulary>to memorize</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to remember</vocabulary> something is to make up a song and play it on your <reading>oboe</reading> (<ja>おぼ</ja>). Something about playing it makes it so you can memorize anything. You're so talented.",
