  "sourceMnemonic": "This word comes from <ja>任せる</ja>, but without the <ja>る</ja> on the end it's a noun. You also have the honorific <ja>お</ja> on the beginning, which is a clue that you're addressing someone else. So you're entrusting something to the person you're talking to, and this means <vocabulary>leaving decisions to someone else</vocabulary>. This is used a lot in restaurants, where it means <vocabulary>chef's choice</vocabulary> or simply <vocabulary>omakase</vocabulary>. In other words, you're leaving the choice of food to the chef.\n\nIt can be used in other contexts, too, like if you leave your haircut up to your stylist or a flower arrangement up to the florist, or even if you follow the recommended program at the gym.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "You learned this reading with the word <ja>任せる</ja>, so I'll leave this one to you.",
