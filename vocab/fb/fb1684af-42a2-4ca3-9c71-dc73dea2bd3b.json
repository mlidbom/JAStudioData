  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will also help if you know how to read <ja>紀元後</ja> already, because then you'll just have to remember the <ja>前</ja>.",
