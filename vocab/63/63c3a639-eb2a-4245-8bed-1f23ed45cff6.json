  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an <ja>い</ja> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>pleasure</kanji>? Well, you could say it's \"pleasurable,\" but I'm afraid that's not what we're going for here. In this case, this word is a little more innocent. It just means <vocabulary>fun</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nHow much <vocabulary>fun</vocabulary> did you have? You just had a <reading>ton o'</reading> (<ja>たの</ja>) fun!",
