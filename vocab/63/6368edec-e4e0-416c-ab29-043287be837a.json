  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You need <vocabulary>to acquire</vocabulary> an <reading>e</reading>lephant (<ja>え</ja>) for your elephant collection. If you don't acquire an elephant, you'll look like an idiot in front of your elephant collecting friends.",
