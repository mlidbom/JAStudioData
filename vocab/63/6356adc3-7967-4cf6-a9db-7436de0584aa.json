  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. This word is actually two words put together, though. <ja>亡く</ja> means \"be deceased.\" <ja>なる</ja> means \"to become.\" So put that all together and you have <vocabulary>to pass away</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to become deceased</vocabulary>. It's basically a polite way to say something died (<ja>死ぬ</ja>).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "To learn to read this kanji you have to remember the <ja>な</ja> part of <ja>亡く</ja>, though our mnemonic will use the whole thing.\n\nIf you're about to become deceased, you are probably <reading>knock</reading>ing (<ja>なく</ja>) on death's door.",
