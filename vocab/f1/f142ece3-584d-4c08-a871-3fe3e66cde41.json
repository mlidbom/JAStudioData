  "sourceMnemonic": "This word is tough, because there's another word in this level (<ja>着る</ja>) that means \"to wear\" that is so similar. This word, however, means <vocabulary>to arrive</vocabulary>. You should have seen that meaning with the kanji <ja>着</ja> as well, so I hope that helps. To differentiate between this and <ja>着る</ja>, though, zoom in on the <ja>く</ja>. You want to be <reading>coo</reading>l (<ja>く</ja>) so you arrive to the party late.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This uses a different kun'yomi reading than the one you just learned (sorry). To help you, think about this:\n\nYou wanted <vocabulary>to arrive</vocabulary> on time but you showed up late.
