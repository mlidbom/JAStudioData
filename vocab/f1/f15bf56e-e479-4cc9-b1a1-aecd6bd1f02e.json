  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading actually comes from the word <ja><reading>氷</reading></ja>, which means \"ice.\" You can kind of see where the origins of these words come from, now... really cold frozen things. So, think back to <ja>こおり</ja>, then change the <ja>り</ja> to a <ja>る</ja> and put it outside the kanji. That makes the reading for this <ja>こおる</ja>, in all (or most) of <ja>氷</ja>'s glory.",
