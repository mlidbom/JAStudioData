  "sourceMnemonic": "You know this is a verb because it ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound. The kanji for this word is <kanji>right</kanji> or <kanji>success</kanji>, so what's the verb form of that? Turns out it's a ton of things. Like, a crazy amount of things. I tried narrowing it down for you, but it will still be a lot. This word tends to be about getting an answer right. As in, <vocabulary>to be right</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be on target</vocabulary>. It means many other things too, but I think these are the two meanings you'll see the most, so focus on those.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the <ja>あ</ja> portion. \n\nWhen your guess turns out <vocabulary>to be right</vocabulary>, you can't help but shout, \"<reading>Ah</reading>! (<ja>あ</ja>)\" That \"Ah\" is your victory cry.",
