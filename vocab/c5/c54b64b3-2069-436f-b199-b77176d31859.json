  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The readings are the vocab words <ja>お酒</ja> and <ja>飲む</ja> combined together into one. You can guess it's a kun'yomi reading because of the <ja>み</ja> on the end of <ja>飲</ja>, which should make you think back to vocab words that use these kanji and the kun'yomi readings. If you can do that, you can read this word (and many others, probably!).",
