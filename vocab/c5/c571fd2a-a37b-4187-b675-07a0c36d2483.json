Literally, this means <vocabulary>to be piled up</vocabulary>, but it's often used to mean <vocabulary>to coincide</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to overlap</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to accumulate</vocabulary>.\n\nAs is often our recommendation for more complicated or hard-to-translate words like this one, check out our common word combinations and context sentences to see how this word is used!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned that reading with 重ねる, but in case it's slipped your mind, here's a mnemonic to help you remember:\n\nAll these boxes that are <vocabulary>piled up</vocabulary> are here because you've just moved into your new <reading>casa</reading> (かさ). Congratulations! Now it's time to unpack every single box you've <vocabulary>accumulate</vocabulary>d. Have fun.",
