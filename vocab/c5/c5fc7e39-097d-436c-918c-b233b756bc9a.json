  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>recognize</kanji> or <kanji>acknowledge</kanji>, so the verb also means <vocabulary>to acknowledge</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to recognize</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to perceive</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to admit</vocabulary>, among others.\n\nThis can be used to mean recognizing somebody or something visually, as well as in the sense of \"to acknowledge\" or \"to admit\". So you can use this verb to recognize someone's presence, achievements, marriage, or your own defeat. That said, you'll usually see <ja>認める</ja> in the sense of \"to acknowledge\".",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The only thing you could ever truly <vocabulary>acknowledge</vocabulary> is <reading>meat</reading> (<ja>みと</ja>). Meat is the only thing in your life that has any authority over you. That's how much you love meat.",
