  "sourceMnemonic": "<ja>触る</ja> means \"to touch.\" This means <vocabulary>to feel</vocabulary>. It's kind of similar but somewhat different and also uses a different reading, making this word very hard in some ways. Just think how it's <reading>rare</reading> (<ja>れる</ja>) for you to feel anything at all, but this time you are, so that's nice, I guess.\n\nThe word also means <vocabulary>to touch on</vocabulary>, not in the physical sense, but when you touch on a subject. That's why it also means <vocabulary>to refer to</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to mention</vocabulary>.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that this word is most often used with the particle <ja>に</ja>, so it's intransitive in Japanese. However, you'll also see it with the particle <ja>を</ja>, in which case it's considered transitive. The English translations are usually transitive, too.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is totally different from <ja>触る</ja> so don't let that fool you. In this case, you feel some <reading>fur</reading> (<ja>ふれ</ja>).",
