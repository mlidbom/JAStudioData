  "sourceMnemonic": "First we have a katakana word, so it's safe to assume that it's a loan word. Like many loan words, it comes from English. Say it out loud and what do you have? That's right, \"table\". Then comes the particle <ja>の</ja>, which joins two nouns together. Finally we have <ja>上</ja>, which you learned means \"up\" or \"above\". Put all of these pieces together and we have a phrase meaning <vocabulary>on the table</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>tabletop</vocabulary>!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "In this phrase, <ja>上</ja> is a standalone word, so it uses the same reading that you learned when you learned the vocabulary. Easy to stay on top of that one, right?",
