  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>collect</kanji> and this verb is transitive, meaning the action is done to something or someone. So this verb means things like <vocabulary>to collect something</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to gather something</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nWhen you only have one thing, there's only one thing. Nothing is collected. But when you have two... \"<reading>ah two</reading>!\" (<ja>あつ</ja>). Now you're starting <vocabulary>to collect something</vocabulary>.",
