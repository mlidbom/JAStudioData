  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>copy</kanji> so you know this means <vocabulary>to copy</vocabulary>. You know this word means \"to copy\" because it ends with <ja>す</ja>. You're copying the documents you need to <reading>sue</reading> (<ja>す</ja>) someone who screwed you over.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have to remember the <ja>うつ</ja> part. To remember that, think of yourself as a beatboxer. You're saying <ja><reading>うつうつうつ</reading></ja> over and over again. Thing is, the other beatboxer is going <vocabulary>to copy</vocabulary> everything you do. That's why you're suing him.",
