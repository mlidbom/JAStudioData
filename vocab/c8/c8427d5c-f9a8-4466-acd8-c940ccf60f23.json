  "sourceMnemonic": "You've already learned that <ja>口</ja> means \"mouth\" and here it's followed by the particle <ja>に</ja>, which pinpoints a location. The verb <ja>する</ja> means \"to do\" so you're doing something to your mouth! Logically enough, this expression is used to describe lots of actions that you do with your mouth. It's often used to mean <vocabulary>to mention</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to say</vocabulary>, but with an added descriptive nuance that you've said something accidentally or unexpectedly, maybe something you shouldn't have said! \uD83D\uDE4A\n\nIt can also mean other things done with the mouth, like <vocabulary>to eat</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to drink</vocabulary>!  ",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "In this expression, <ja>口</ja> is a standalone vocabulary word, so it uses the same reading that you learned when you learned the vocabulary.",
