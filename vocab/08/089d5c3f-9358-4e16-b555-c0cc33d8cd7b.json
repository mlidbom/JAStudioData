  "sourceMnemonic": "When a vocab word is a single kanji and alone, it tends to steal the meaning from the kanji. Same goes for this one too. It means <vocabulary>above</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>up</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "When a vocab word is a single kanji and doesn't have okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually will use the kun'yomi. Since you learned the on'yomi reading of the kanji, we'll need to use a mnemonic to learn the reading of this vocabulary word. \n\n<vocabulary>Above</vocabulary> you is a huge weight. You're holding it up and struggling (it's heavy!). You look up and try to crane your neck to see how much it <reading>weigh</reading>s (<ja>うえ</ja>), but you can't see the numbers on the side of it. How long can you hold it above your head like this?",
