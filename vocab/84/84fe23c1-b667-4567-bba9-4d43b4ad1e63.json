  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou have <vocabulary>to wash</vocabulary> <reading>a ro</reading>ck (<ja>あら</ja>) you found. It looks shiny, but you can't tell until you wash it.",
