  "sourceMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Additionally on top of <vocabulary>thing</vocabulary> there are the meanings <vocabulary>matter</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>action</vocabulary> as well. Like the kanji, this word has to do with action things... things that you do, for example, rather than physical things.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\nIt's hard to start a mnemonic with the word \"thing\" or \"action,\" so let's continue off the kanji mnemonic where you've put a cross in the mouth of a wolverine.  Why did you do it? You knew that feisty wolverine was going to eat your <reading>coat</reading> (<ja>こと</ja>).",
