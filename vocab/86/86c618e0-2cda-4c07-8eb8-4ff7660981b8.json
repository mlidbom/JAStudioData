The kanji itself means <kanji>hit</kanji> so the vocab is <vocabulary>to hit something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to pound something</vocabulary>. It can also mean <vocabulary>to type</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This word uses the kun'yomi reading, which you haven't learned yet, but never fear! A mnemonic is here:\n\nSomething is coming toward your face. It's black and spiky and it's definitely going <vocabulary>to hit</vocabulary> you right in the eye. It's an <reading>u</reading>ni (<ja>う</ja>). Have you ever seen one of those things before? You definitely aren't going to be happy with whoever is trying to hit you with an uni.",
