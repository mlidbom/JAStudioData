  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>extreme</kanji>. The verb vocab version isn't \"to extreme\" because that wouldn't make sense. Instead, you carry it to extremes, making this word <vocabulary>to carry to extremes</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to master</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWhen you go <vocabulary>to carry to extremes</vocabulary>, you're going too far, so there has to be a <reading>key wo</reading>rd (<ja>きわ</ja>) that you say to make the other person stop. \"CACAO! CACAO!\"",
