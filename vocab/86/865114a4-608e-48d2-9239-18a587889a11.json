  "sourceMnemonic": "Do you remember the words <ja>出口</ja> (exit) and <ja>入り口</ja> (entrance) from previous levels? The <ja>口</ja> can be a doorway of some kind. This word is literally \"door mouth\" but I bet you can figure out that this actually means <vocabulary>doorway</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading for this one is mixed. You get the kun'yomi readings for both kanji, even though it's a combo (jukugo) kanji. Since <ja>戸</ja>'s only reading is the kun'yomi reading you should know it. Also, you should know the kun'yomi reading for <ja>口</ja> as well from level 1. That means as long as you remember that this is a kun'yomi fest over here, you should be able to read this word. Also watch out for the rendaku (also known as sequential voicing). That just means the <ja>く</ja> becomes the voiced <ja>ぐ</ja>.",
