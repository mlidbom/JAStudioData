  "sourceMnemonic": "Remember the secondary meaning of <ja>本</ja>? It's \"origin.\" So, this word technically means \"sun origin.\" Does that sound familiar? Japan's known as \"The land of the rising sun.\" That's why <vocabulary>Japan</vocabulary> comes from <ja>日本</ja>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well, though take note that the <ja>日</ja> portion is shortened a bit. So instead of being <ja><reading>にち</reading></ja> it is just <ja><reading>に</reading></ja>.",
