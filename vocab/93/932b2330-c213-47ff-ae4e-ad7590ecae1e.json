First, though, we should probably define <vocabulary>right and wrong</vocabulary>.\n\nThis word means \"absolutely\" when it's used as an adverb, and that's the use you'll hear most in conversation. However, as a noun it means \"right and wrong\", as in whether something is right or wrong, or good or bad.",
