  "sourceMnemonic": "The <kanji>simple</kanji> bits of <kanji>language</kanji> are the individual <vocabulary>word</vocabulary>s. If you think about it, this is true. First of all, there are a ton of them. Second, they're tiny. They're just little bits of language and the \"word\" for these little bits is <vocabulary>word</vocabulary>.\n\nSo what’s the difference between this and <ja>言葉</ja>? Well, <ja>言葉</ja> can cover any meaningful set of words – anything from words, sentences and paragraphs, to whole texts and even languages. <ja>単語</ja>, on the other hand, is a subset of <ja>言葉</ja> that specifically refers to single, distinct words.",
