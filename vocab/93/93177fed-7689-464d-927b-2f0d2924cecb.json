  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>preserve</kanji> and the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to preserve something</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to keep something</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to maintain something</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a transitive verb, so it takes a direct object. You preserve something, like your youth.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nIf you want to learn how <vocabulary>to preserve something</vocabulary> like fruits and veggies, you should start with <reading>tamots</reading> (<ja>たも</ja>), that's slang for delish tomatoes. Once they're preserved, you get to make everyone you love eat those yummy tamots. Mmm!",
