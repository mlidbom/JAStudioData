  "sourceMnemonic": "You already know that <ja>手</ja> means \"hand,\" but it can also mean \"doer,\" as in someone who performs a particular action or task. Why? Because we use our hands to do things. And when it comes to <kanji>throw</kanji>ing, the <kanji>doer</kanji> is the <vocabulary>pitcher</vocabulary>!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <ja>手</ja> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nTo be a good <vocabulary>pitcher</vocabulary>, all you have to do is put the ball into the <reading>chute</reading> (<ja>しゅ</ja>). Pitchers don't actually throw the ball. There is an invisible pitching chute right on the mound. You slide the ball into the chute and off it goes!",
