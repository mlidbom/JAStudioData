  "sourceMnemonic": "Remember <ja>広い</ja>? Well this is like that, except a verb. When something does the action of getting <kanji>wide</kanji>, it means <vocabulary>to spread out</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to extend</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to stretch</vocabulary>.\n\nYou already learned <ja>広げる</ja>, which is used when YOU spread something. <ja>広がる</ja>, on the other hand, means that something spreads out all on its own. It's worth mentioning that lots of intransitive verbs end in <ja>がる</ja>, and this is no exception. Just think how about a girl (<ja>がる</ja>) you know can do everything all by herself. She never needs help from anyone else.",
