Well, this isn't going to help you much, because this means <vocabulary>bento</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>box lunch</vocabulary>. Chances are, though, you know the word \"bento\" from English. So, if you read this word (which you should be able to) you can figure out it's <ja>べんとう</ja>. If you do that, you can realize this word means <vocabulary>bento</vocabulary> too!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.",
