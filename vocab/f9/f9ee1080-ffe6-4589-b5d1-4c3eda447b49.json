If you can remember that, you can remember this too! Oh and sometimes you'll see this written <ja>空瓶</ja> without the kana too. And when that happens it can be read <ja>からびん</ja>! So if you learned it one way and not the other, don't worry, we'll take both here. Just know that seeing it as <ja>空き瓶</ja> (and pronouncing it <ja>あきびん</ja>) is way more common.",
