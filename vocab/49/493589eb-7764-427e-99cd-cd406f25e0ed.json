  "sourceMnemonic": "<kanji>Melon</kanji>s from the <kanji>south</kanji> are lumpy and orange, sometimes orange and green because they try to look like the hot sun. Wait, those aren't melons, they're <vocabulary>pumpkin</vocabulary>s and <vocabulary>squash</vocabulary>. Or... kind of a mix of the two, if you already know what <vocabulary>kabocha</vocabulary> tastes like. ",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading for this is an exception, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:\n\nJapanese <vocabulary>pumpkin</vocabulary>s don't taste like American pumpkins. They taste more like <reading>can</reading>ned <reading>bo</reading>iled <reading>cho</reading>colate (<ja>かぼちゃ</ja>). Oh, you don't know that either? Well then just taste the pumpkin and you'll know what that tastes like too.\n\nThis word is also sometimes read <ja>なんきん</ja>, especially in the east of Japan.",
