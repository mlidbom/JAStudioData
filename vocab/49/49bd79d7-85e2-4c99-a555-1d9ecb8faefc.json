When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You are counting your <vocabulary>bundle</vocabulary>s. There are a lot of them, so you have to create <reading>tab</reading>s (<ja>たば</ja>) in your notebook to properly categorize everything. Imagine yourself doing this (physically creating the tabs in your notebook, even though your notebook didn't come with tabs).",
