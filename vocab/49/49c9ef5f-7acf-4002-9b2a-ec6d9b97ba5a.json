  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>scatter</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to be scattered</vocabulary>. You know that this verb represents when something is scattering (you're not doing the scattering), because you would never be so <reading>ru</reading>de as to scatter someone or something yourself. It only happens when it happens on its own.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Think about something scattering. That something is <reading>chee</reading>se (<ja>ち</ja>), scattering all over the floor, going everywhere, getting in everything. Ugh, you hate how cheese scatters, don't you?",
