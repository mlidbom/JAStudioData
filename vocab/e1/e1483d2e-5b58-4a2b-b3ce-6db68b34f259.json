  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>run</kanji> so now you know the verb version of that is <vocabulary>to run</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have to remember the <ja>はし</ja> portion. Think of yourself running. It's nice. As you run, though, you notice the ground changing into something weird and mushy. Everything is turning into <reading>hash</reading> (<ja>はし</ja>) browns. You start to get sucked in, and soon you can't run anymore. Smell the hash browns and taste them too. What a terrible run this was.",
