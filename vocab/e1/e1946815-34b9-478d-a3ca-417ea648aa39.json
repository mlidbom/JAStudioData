They don't really have a home, but they keep hanging around yours. It's kind of annoying. (This word has a negative connotation, you wouldn't use it for someone who is just homeless, unless you're really mean.)",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <ja>浮</ja> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nAll the <vocabulary>vagrant</vocabulary>s you know are <reading>foo</reading>ls (<ja>ふ</ja>). They just left their homes and now they float around your city for no reason. You ask them why and they shrug. You've never seen a better definition of a fool before in your life!",
