  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>concurrently</kanji>, but since you can't \"to concurrently\", we're going to have to come up with another word to use: \"<vocabulary>to combine</vocabulary>\" or \"<vocabulary>to double as</vocabulary>.\" Since this kanji has to do with something having a dual purpose, we can say that something can combine as being another thing, or double as being another thing, which is where these words come from.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "For example, a <reading>ca</reading>r (<ja>か</ja>) can double as a place to sleep at night when not enough people become members of WaniKani.",
