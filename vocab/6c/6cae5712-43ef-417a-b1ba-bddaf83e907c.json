The kanji itself means <kanji>end</kanji> and so the verb version of this is <vocabulary>to end</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to be over</vocabulary>.\n\nIt's an intransitive verb, meaning it happens on its own. Something ends, but you don't cause it to end. ",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThis situation has <vocabulary>to end</vocabulary>. You're the <reading>ower</reading> (<ja>おわ</ja>) of a lot of money. For this to end, you need to pay back all that money. Try to think of ways to stop being an ower so this stressful situation can end!",
