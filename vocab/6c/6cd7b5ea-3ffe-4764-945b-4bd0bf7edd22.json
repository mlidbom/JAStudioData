The kanji itself means <kanji>isolate</kanji> and the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to isolate</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to partition</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to separate</vocabulary>.

Because all he could do was <reading>header</reading>s (<ja>へだ</ja>) and that was getting pretty dangerous. He would head everything in his reach. He was going crazy with headers. He had to be isolated!",
