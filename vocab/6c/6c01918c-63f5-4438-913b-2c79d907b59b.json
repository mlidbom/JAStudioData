The kanji itself means <kanji>return home</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to return home</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to return</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to go home</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. You can return home happily, knowing how to read this word! \n\nThis word has a pair verb though, so you'll want to remember the <ja>る</ja> ending. Just imagine how <reading>ru</reading>de (<ja>る</ja>) it is when someone goes home without saying goodbye. The nerve!",
