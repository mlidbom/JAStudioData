  "sourceMnemonic": "This starts with another katakana word, so you can assume that it's a loan word. This one also comes from English. Can you figure out what it means? That's right, \"bed\". Then comes the particle <ja>の</ja>, which joins two nouns together. Finally, we have <ja>下</ja>, which you learned means \"down\" or \"below\". Put these elements together and you get <vocabulary>below the bed</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>under the bed</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>beneath the bed</vocabulary>. What's under your bed?",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "<ja>下</ja> is a standalone word here, so it uses the same reading that you learned when you learned the vocabulary.",
