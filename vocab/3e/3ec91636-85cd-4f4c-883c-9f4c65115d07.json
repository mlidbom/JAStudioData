  "sourceMnemonic": "A <kanji>strange</kanji> <kanji>action</kanji> that takes place is something that shouldn't have happened (but it did). This is a <vocabulary>strange incident</vocabulary>. The difference between this and <ja>事変</ja> is that while <ja>事変</ja> can also be used to describe a strange incident, it also can be used to talk about another type of incident as well. For example, the \"Manshuu Jihen\" is the \"Manshuu Incident.\" This word, <ja>変事</ja> is more just a strange or unusual incident.",
