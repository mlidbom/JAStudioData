  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYour mourning is especially <vocabulary>unpleasant</vocabulary> because it's your pet <reading>ea</reading>gle (<ja>い</ja>) you're mourning for. Your parents wouldn't let you bury him so you're just staring at his week old, dead eagle body. It's super <vocabulary>disgusting</vocabulary>, actually.",
