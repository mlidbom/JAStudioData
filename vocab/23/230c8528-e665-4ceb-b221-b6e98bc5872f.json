  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>increase</kanji>, so the vocabulary verb version means <vocabulary>to increase</vocabulary>. This is when something is just increasing on its own, and you're not doing the increasing. You know this because you like to <reading>err</reading> (<ja>える</ja>) on the side of caution and not touch anything when it's increasing, therefore you're not doing any of the increasing yourself (it's just happening).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "It would be <reading>foo</reading>lish (<ja>ふ</ja>) of you to touch anything while things are increasing anyways. You don't want to mess up a good thing, do you? Don't be a fool.",
