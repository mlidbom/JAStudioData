  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will also help if you know the reading of <ja>研究</ja> already. Also note that <ja>所</ja> is normal for one reading, but also gets the rendaku treatment, meaning <ja>しょ</ja> becomes <ja>じょ</ja>, for the secondary reading.",
