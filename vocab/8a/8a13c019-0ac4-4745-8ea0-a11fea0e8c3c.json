  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a food pretty specific to Japan, making it a slightly weird one to learn. You have a <kanji>Japanese Plum</kanji>. Then you have <kanji>dry</kanji>. So when the Japanese plum is dried, it's not a dried plum (that would be too easy), it is a <vocabulary>pickled plum</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>pickled ume</vocabulary>. If you know the name of this food, you can call it by that too: <vocabulary>umeboshi</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading for this one, like the meaning, is kind of strange. It's the kun'yomi readings, so apologies in advance for that. You have <ja>うめ</ja> plus <ja>ぼし</ja>, which comes from <ja>干す</ja> though the <ja>し</ja> is stuffed inside the <ja>干</ja> for some reason. It's also rendaku'd. Basically, everything is all screwed up, so you know, deal with it. This food is awesome, and common, so you have to learn it. I guess the pickling process has mangled the reading of this word. At least it tastes good.",
