  "sourceMnemonic": "When there's nothing but <kanji>fold</kanji>s and <kanji>angle</kanji>s, you have quite a mess. This word means <vocabulary>with trouble</vocabulary> because you certainly aren't traversing along a nice, flat piece of space-time, are you? Nah, it's all angled and folded.\n\n<ja>折角</ja> is one of those tricky Japanese words that doesn’t have one neat translation in English. The nuance is that something has come about with trouble, either through someone’s efforts, or a stroke of luck. It often implies regret, and is used in situations where you want to express that <vocabulary>valuable</vocabulary> opportunities, advice, or hard work were in vain for some reason. It’s also used to underline a <vocabulary>rare</vocabulary> chance that shouldn’t be missed.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Watch out for the <ja>せつ</ja> changing to <ja>せっ</ja>, though. Another thing you have to go through <vocabulary>with trouble</vocabulary>, I'm afraid.",
