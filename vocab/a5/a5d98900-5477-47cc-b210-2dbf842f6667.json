He's your <vocabulary>uncle</vocabulary>. This word can be used for your mother's brother too, but in both cases he has to be the older brother, not younger.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading for this is an exception, at least the <ja>父</ja> part is, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember:\n\nYour <vocabulary>uncle</vocabulary> is a very religious man, he is the chief, after all. Whenever you see him he's always shouting, \"<reading>Oh Je</reading>sus! (<ja>おじ</ja>)\" at the sky. Your uncle and Jesus are pretty close.",
