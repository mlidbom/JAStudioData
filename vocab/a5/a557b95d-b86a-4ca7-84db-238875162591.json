  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>dirty</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to get dirty</vocabulary>. You know you're not doing the dirtying, because it's <reading>rare</reading> (<ja>れる</ja>) for you to get anything dirty, though things do get dirty on their own.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Things seem <vocabulary>to get dirty</vocabulary> easily around here, which is why <reading>you go</reading> (<ja>よご</ja>) to great lengths to keep things clean.\n\nNote that the reading <ja>よごれる</ja> is generally used for getting physically dirty, whereas <ja>けがれる</ja> is more figurative, so more like “to be defiled”.",
