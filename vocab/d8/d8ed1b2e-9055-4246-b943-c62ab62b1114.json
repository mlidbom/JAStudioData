  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>muddy</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to make muddy</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to make cloudy</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nIf you want <vocabulary>to make muddy</vocabulary>, meaning make yourself muddy, you should have your <reading>knee</reading>s <reading>go</reading> (<ja>にご</ja>) first. When you have your knees go first the mud splashes all over you but you don't hurt your hands or your butt doing it.",
