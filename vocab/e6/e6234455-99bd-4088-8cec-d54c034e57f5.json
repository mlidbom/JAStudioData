If you're eating rice at a meal you'd call it <ja>ごはん</ja>. This is like when you're talking about the rice in the fields or rice grains or something like that.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\n\"Everyone, we have rice! <reading>Come</reading> (<ja>こめ</ja>) and get it!\"",
