  "sourceMnemonic": "If you have a <kanji>part</kanji> of a <kanji>roof</kanji>, that part is your <vocabulary>room</vocabulary>. Just imagine a roof divided into sections in a house, with the sections going all the way down to the ground. Each section is its own room, right?",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading of <ja>部屋</ja> is a bit unusual. Both <ja>屋</ja> and <ja>部</ja> uses kun'yomi readings. It's actually read as <ja>へ</ja>, due to something called ateji. Ateji is when kanji are used just for their sound, regardless of meaning; or just for their meaning, regardless of sound. In this case it's the former, as <ja>部</ja> was chosen for its archaic <ja>べ</ja> reading, which was close enough to <ja>へ</ja>. This is all a bit much, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember this reading:\n\nJust imagine that you rent out a <vocabulary>room</vocabulary> and the only one they have left is the <reading>hay</reading> (<ja>へ</ja>) room in the barn, so you sleep there for the night. Imagine the smell of hay and how scratchy it is to sleep in this room.",
