  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>leg</kanji> or <kanji>sufficient</kanji>, and we're going with the \"sufficient\" meaning for this word! This word means <vocabulary>to be enough</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the <ja>た</ja> portion. Whenever we need to remember the <ja>た</ja> we use the word \"taco.\" \n\nWhat do you have enough of? What is sufficient? Turns out it's <reading>ta</reading>cos (<ja>た</ja>). Your bunker is filled with them and it's going <vocabulary>to be enough</vocabulary> to last the winter.",
