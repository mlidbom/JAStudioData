  "sourceMnemonic": "This word has the same meaning that you learned with the kanji: <vocabulary>part</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>portion</vocabulary>. By extension, it can also mean <vocabulary>content</vocabulary>, as in \"alcohol content\" because that's the portion of alcohol in a drink.\n\nThis word is used for fractions, too, as in one third or one quarter. Again, you can see how this links to \"parts\" and \"portions\", right?",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This word is usually combined with other words, which is probably why this single kanji vocab word uses the on'yomi instead of the kun'yomi. If you know the kanji reading, you know this vocab's reading as well, but the reading is different depending on the meaning:\n\nIf it means <vocabulary>part</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>portion</vocabulary>, it's read <ja>ぶん</ja>. Probably because your buns come in two parts. Ohoho.",
