  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>neglect</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to be negligent</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to neglect</vocabulary> something.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nIf you always seem <vocabulary>to be negligent</vocabulary> to your kids you'll end up with this situation. It's winter and your kid comes home from school covered in snow and sneezing. \"<reading>Oh, coat</reading>... (<ja>おこた</ja>)\" you say. You didn't give them a coat when they went out today. Maybe if you weren't so negligent that wouldn't have happened.",
