  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. \n\nYou have already learned the reading for <ja>器</ja> but <ja>楽</ja> uses the secondary reading so you may not have learned it.  However, you learned this reading in the word <ja>音楽</ja>. Just bear in mind that the <ja>がく</ja> shortens to <ja>がっ</ja>.",
