  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends in an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. More specifically, this verb ends in <ja>まる</ja>, and most verbs with this ending are intransitive, meaning the action or change happens on its own.\n\nThe kanji <ja>温</ja> means <kanji>warm</kanji>. So this verb means <vocabulary>to get warm</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to warm up</vocabulary>. To help you distinguish this from <ja>温める</ja>, you could think of a circle (<ja>まる</ja>) rolling down a hill all by itself, and getting warmer and warmer as it picks up speed. ",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The kanji reading is the same as <ja>温かい</ja> and <ja>温める</ja>. ",
