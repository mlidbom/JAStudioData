Here's a mnemonic to help you remember:\n\nHaving a <reading>sober</reading>(<ja>そば</ja>) person by your <vocabulary>side</vocabulary> is important when you're drunk. \n\nThink of other vocabulary words that use <reading><ja>がわ</ja></reading>. In these words, <kanji><ja>側</ja></kanji> is a suffix, so it will have another kanji that comes before it. \n\n\n",
