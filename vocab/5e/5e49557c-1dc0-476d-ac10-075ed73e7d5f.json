  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an <ja>い</ja> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>fear</kanji>? <vocabulary>Scary</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>frightening</vocabulary>. It can also mean <vocabulary>I'm afraid</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>I'm scared </vocabulary> too.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou know what's really scary? <reading>Koa</reading>las (<ja>こわ</ja>). Have you ever heard one of those things? They're super scary, don't go near them.",
