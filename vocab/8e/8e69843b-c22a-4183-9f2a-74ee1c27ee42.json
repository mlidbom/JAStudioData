  "sourceMnemonic": "When you <kanji>obtain</kanji> something you need to keep it safe, so you decide <vocabulary>to store</vocabulary> it somewhere. Then you can always go back and look at the thing you managed <vocabulary>to achieve</vocabulary>,  <vocabulary>to score</vocabulary>, or at least <vocabulary>to finish</vocabulary>, and no one can take it from you.\n\n<ja>収める</ja> means \"to store\" with an emphasis on placing something in their proper location. This nuance extends to convey a sense of accomplishment, such as \"achieving a favorable outcome.”",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with <ja>収まる</ja>, but here's a mnemonic to remind you just in case:\n\nYou need <vocabulary>to store</vocabulary> all of the <reading>o</reading>ld <reading>saw</reading>s (<ja>おさ</ja>). You were able <vocabulary>to finish</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to achieve</vocabulary> everything you wanted with them, so it's time to put them away so they'll be safe.",
