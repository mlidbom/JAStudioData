  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>obey</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to obey</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nI am going <vocabulary>to obey</vocabulary> you. I think your order is a bit of <reading>shit <ja>が</ja></reading> (<ja>したが</ja>), I'll do it and obey you. \n\n(Little side note, did you know <ja>が</ja> in the middle of a sentence can mean \"but\" in Japanese? Think of it as that meaning here.)",
