  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "You want to go <vocabulary>far</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>far away</vocabulary> when you see a <reading>toe... oh</reading> (<ja>とお</ja>)! You realize there is a zombie toe on the ground and it reminds you of where you can go that's far from here—where the zombie that once had this toe went! (Remember the kanji mnemonic? It's that scooter zombie's toe that makes you say oh and want to go.)",
