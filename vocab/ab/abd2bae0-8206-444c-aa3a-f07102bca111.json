  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>wake up</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to wake up</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to get up</vocabulary>.\n\nThis word also has a secondary meaning of <vocabulary>to occur</vocabulary>. Think of it this way: when an action \"wakes up\", in a way it is occurring as well. ",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, so tomorrow when you wake up you hopefully won't have to relearn this vocab's reading.",
