  "sourceMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n\nDon't confuse this with <ja>〜間</ja> which is similar in meaning but different in reading. The <ja>〜間</ja> means it's attached to something. This is a standalone word.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. <ja>間</ja> has two common kun'yomi readings, <ja>あいだ</ja> and <ja>ま</ja>. You haven't learned these readings yet, so here's an explanation of each reading and mnemonics to help you remember them: \n\nWhen <ja>間</ja> refers to a longer interval of time, it's generally read as <ja>あいだ</ja>. For a short burst of time, it's read as <ja>ま</ja>. When it means an interval of space, it's usually read as <ja>あいだ</ja>. \n\nYou can remember this because time feels longer in <reading>Ida</reading>ho (<ja>あいだ</ja>). Any interval of time you spend there feels so long, because Idaho life moves so slowly. As soon as you cross the border and enter a new state, you call your <reading>ma</reading> (<ja>ま</ja>) to tell her you're finally out of that slooooow state, and the intervals of time feel shorter.
