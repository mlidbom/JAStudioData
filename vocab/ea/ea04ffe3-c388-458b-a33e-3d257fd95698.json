  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: What do people who are <vocabulary>gentle</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>kind</vocabulary> say when someone asks of them a favor? Always \"<reading>yessir</reading>\" (<ja>やさ</ja>). Always, always \"yessir\"!",
