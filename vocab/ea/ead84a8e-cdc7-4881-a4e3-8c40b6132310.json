  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>celebrate</kanji>, so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to celebrate</vocabulary>. When you burn this word, you should <ja>祝う</ja>!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: When you celebrate something, you have to yell out your celebrations. Yell out <ja><reading>いわう</reading></ja> three times! It's kind of like a combination of the word <ja>いい</ja> (good) and \"wow.\" <ja>いい</ja>wow! <ja>いい</ja>wow! Just make sure the <ja>いい</ja> gets shortened, because it's getting combined.",
