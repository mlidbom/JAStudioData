  "sourceMnemonic": "You've probably seen the word <ja>回る</ja>, which means \"to revolve.\" This word is similar, except for you're doing the turning/rotating action on something else. You can simply say <vocabulary>to turn something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to rotate something</vocabulary> when answering this question, but be sure to think of yourself actually turning/rotating something. Remember this by using the <ja>す</ja> on the end. You've taken your friend <reading>Sue</reading> and put her on a stick. You're rotating her over a fire on a spit because you're a sick cannibal.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the word <ja>回る</ja> (<ja>まわ</ja>). So long as you know that level 5 word, you'll be able to read this one as well. Use both of these words together to remember their readings.",
