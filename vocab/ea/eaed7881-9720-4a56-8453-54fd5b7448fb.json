  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>violence</kanji>. \"To violence\" doesn't sound great, so instead this word is <vocabulary>to act violently</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to rage</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're about <vocabulary>to rage</vocabulary> all over the place. You're going nuts. You're going <vocabulary>to act violently</vocabulary>. Then, a calm wizard steps in front of you and mutters \"<reading>aba</reading>ra kadabara,\" (<ja>あば</ja>) causing you to calm down immediately.",
