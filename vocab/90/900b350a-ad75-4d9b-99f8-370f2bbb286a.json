  "sourceMnemonic": "Since the kanji <ja>月</ja> means both \"moon\" and \"month,\" what is the sixth month of the year? January, February, March, April, May, <vocabulary>June</vocabulary>!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. <ja>月</ja> has two on'yomi readings, but it always uses the <ja>がつ</ja> reading in the names of the months, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember that:\n\n<vocabulary>June</vocabulary> always gives you <reading>rock</reading> <reading>guts</reading> (<ja>ろくがつ</ja>). In June, your guts mysteriously become as hard as rock, which makes for terrible indigestion.",
