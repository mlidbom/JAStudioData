  "sourceMnemonic": "This is like a very formal and humble way of saying <vocabulary>to know</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to believe</vocabulary>. Sure, the kanji means <kanji>suppose</kanji>, but think of it this way... When you say \"I suppose\" it's like a humble way of saying \"I know\" or \"I believe.\" You're not being as direct about it this way, and in Japanese, that makes you more humble and polite. So, that's why <ja>存じる</ja> means <vocabulary>to know</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to believe</vocabulary>.\n\nNote this word is typically used in the polite ます form. When you’re humble, you may want to be as polite as possible, I suppose!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. If you remember the kanji reading, you'll have no problem remembering this vocabulary reading as well!",
