  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>blame</kanji> so this also means <vocabulary>to blame</vocabulary>. Additionally, this can also mean <vocabulary>to criticize</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to reproach</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to accuse</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou <reading>say</reading> (<ja>せ</ja>) I did it. I <reading>say</reading> you did it. Everyone is going <vocabulary>to blame</vocabulary> everyone, apparently!",
