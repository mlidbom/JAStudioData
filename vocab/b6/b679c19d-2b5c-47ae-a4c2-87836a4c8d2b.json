The kanji itself means <kanji>say humbly</kanji>, and this is just the verb form, <vocabulary>to say humbly</vocabulary>. You can also call this <vocabulary>to say</vocabulary>, just remember that it's humble!\n\nThis is a very humble way to say \"to say\" so it's used in especially formal situations, and only to talk about yourself or your associates. Because of its formality, it's almost always in the <ja>ます</ja> form, which is <ja>申します</ja>.",
