  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an <ja>い</ja> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. More precisely, it has <ja>しい</ja> on the end, which makes it even more likely it's an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>beauty</kanji>? It's <vocabulary>beautiful</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you. It's a long reading for a mnemonic, but try your best. \n\nYou look at someone who is <vocabulary>beautiful</vocabulary>. What an easy life they've lived. No hard work and all they do is pamper themselves to stay beautiful. Feel disgusted. You walk up to this person and say: \"<reading>U too cushy</reading>! (<ja>うつくしい</ja>). \n\nSorry for adding the whole word in there for the reading mnemonic, but I thought it worked out better that way. Just know that the word isn't <ja>うつくしいしい</ja> or something weird like that. The hiragana on the end is part of the mnemonic as well.",
