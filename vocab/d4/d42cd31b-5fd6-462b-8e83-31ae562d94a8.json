  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a tough one. When you <kanji>compare</kanji> <kanji>examples</kanji> (in this case of numbers) you are figuring out the <vocabulary>proportion</vocabulary> / <vocabulary>ratio</vocabulary>. A ratio, for example, has one number on top of another. They are examples being compared. Same with proportions. Without two things to compare, proportion doesn't make sense. That's why when you compare examples, you are dealing with proportions or ratios.",
