  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a strange one, but only at first glance. You <kanji>make</kanji> a <kanji>house</kanji>. You'd think this would mean something like \"building a house\" or \"construction\" or something. Instead, it means writer. Think of it this way: A <vocabulary>writer</vocabulary> <kanji>makes</kanji> (writes and creates works) in their <kanji>home</kanji>. Writers don't make their word magic in a corporate office!\n\n<ja>作家</ja> is generally used to refer to someone who writes professionally as an occupation, especially in the field of literature. It can also be used more broadly to refer to a creator who produces individual works of art or craft.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since the <ja>さく</ja> reading of <ja>作</ja> becomes <ja>さっ</ja> here, we've made a mnemonic for you to remember this reading:\n\n<vocabulary>Writer</vocabulary>s love <reading>soccer</reading> (<ja>さっか</ja>). In fact, playing soccer is how they get their inspiration. Try playing some soccer, maybe you'll become a <vocabulary>creator</vocabulary> too!",
