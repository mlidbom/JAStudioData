  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>divide</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to divide</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to split something</vocabulary>.\n\nIt can also mean <vocabulary>to break something</vocabulary>, as in <ja>ワイングラスを割る</ja> (to break a wine glass). After all, you’re technically dividing the object into parts if you break it, right?",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading you learned with the kanji is the one you'll use here. It's the <ja>わ</ja> one, though, making it <ja>わる</ja>.",
