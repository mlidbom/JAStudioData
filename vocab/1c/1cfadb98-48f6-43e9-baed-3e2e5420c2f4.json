  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>well</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to well up</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou're fishing in a hole in the ice when suddenly the water starts <vocabulary>to well up</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to gush forth</vocabulary> out of it. A huge <reading>wa</reading>lrus (<ja>わ</ja>) splashes out and jumps on you. No wonder there weren't any fish! This is a walrus hole.",
