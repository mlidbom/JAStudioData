  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>wait</kanji> so this word has something to do with waiting. Use the <ja>たせ</ja> as a hint. Someone \"tossed\" a ball off into a ditch, and then they had to find it. They made you wait for them to get the ball too, even though it's a cheap piece of crap. Feel upset about this. That'll help you remember that this means <vocabulary>to make someone wait</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to keep someone waiting</vocabulary>.",
