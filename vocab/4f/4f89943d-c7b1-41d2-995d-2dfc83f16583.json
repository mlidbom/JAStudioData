That's why this verb is <vocabulary>to add something</vocabulary>, because you keep adding things until you <ja>足りる</ja>.\n\nThis verb is transitive, like most verbs ending in <ja>す</ja>, which is why you are adding something. It's not getting itself added all by itself. Maybe you add so much that someone tries to <reading>sue</reading> (<ja>す</ja>) you for that nasty pile of squirrels you keep outside.",
