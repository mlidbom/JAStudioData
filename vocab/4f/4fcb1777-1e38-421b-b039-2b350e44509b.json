  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>detach</kanji>, but what happens when something detaches? It causes it <vocabulary>to separate</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to leave</vocabulary>. This refers to when something separates on its own. You aren't doing the separating. You know this because it's <reading>rare</reading> (<ja>れる</ja>) to see things separate, but sometimes you do see them. Also, whenever you see <ja>れる</ja> usually it's a safe bet that you're not the one doing the action, right? Think about it.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "For the reading, think about what is separating. It's quite sad, because all of the <ja><reading>花</reading></ja>s (<ja>はな</ja>) are separating from their stems and falling on the ground, and nobody knows why. Just falling off and being sad.",
