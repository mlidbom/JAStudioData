  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>line up</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to be lined up</vocabulary>. You know this is the version where things are just lined up (you're not doing the lining up) because you keep saying <reading>boo</reading> (<ja>ぶ</ja>), why is everyone already lined up? I should have got here earlier so I don't have to wait (if you were doing the lining up yourself, you'd put yourself in the front, duh).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Only for you, when you visit <reading>Nara</reading> (<ja>なら</ja>), the deer there are <vocabulary>to be lined up</vocabulary> for you to inspect, as you are the deer inspector. If you don't know about Nara and its deer, you should look it up, they're pretty awesome.",
