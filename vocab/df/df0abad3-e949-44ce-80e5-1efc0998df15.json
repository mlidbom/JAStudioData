The meaning for the kanji is <kanji>noisy</kanji> and <kanji>picky</kanji>, so the adjective version is also <vocabulary>noisy</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>picky</vocabulary>.\n\nThis type of noisy can be just about being noisy, like a group of turkeys. It can also be a \"\"picky\"\" sort of noisy, when someone is being particular in a vocal sort of way.",
