The kanji itself means <kanji>hollow</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to become hollow</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to sink</vocabulary>",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou feel like you've started <vocabulary>to become hollow</vocabulary> when you have a <reading>he</reading>ad <reading>co</reading>ld (<ja>へこ</ja>). You may be all stuffed up, but it's making you so sad that you feel hollow somehow.",
