  "sourceMnemonic": "When you see a katakana word, it's a safe bet that it is a foreign loan word from somewhere else. This one's interesting, because it combines katakana and kanji! The first <vocabulary>marble</vocabulary> came to Japan from Portugal, so the <ja>ビー</ja> part of the word is short for \"vidro,\" which means \"glass\" in Portuguese. Anyway, don't get thrown off by that <ja>ビー</ja>. Maybe just imagine that your favorite marble is black and yellow like a bee.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "If you know katakana as well as the reading that you learned when you learned the kanji <kanji><ja>玉</ja></kanji>, you should be able to read this. Just watch out for the rendaku.",
