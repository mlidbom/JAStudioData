  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\nYou've reached <vocabulary>the end</vocabulary> of the universe. Nothing is there. You step out, and you're surprised because you get greeted by an old Canadian man. <reading>Sue, eh?</reading>(<ja>すえ</ja>) he asks you, over and over. The poor man is looking for his wife Sue, and he's searched to the end of the universe. That's true love. As he walks off into the distance, you hear him calling out, \"Sue, eh? Sue, eh? Sue, eh?\" ",
