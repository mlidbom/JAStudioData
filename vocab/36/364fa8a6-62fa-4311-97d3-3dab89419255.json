  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The <ja>ゆ</ja> part of the reading makes sense. The <ja>げ</ja> part for <ja>気</ja> is a bit of an exception, so here's a mnemonic to help with that:\n\nNo creature likes <vocabulary>steam</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>vapor</vocabulary> more than <reading>ge</reading>ckos (<ja>げ</ja>). Geckos live in hot places, so wherever you see steam, you'll be sure to see at least one gecko nearby, if you look hard enough.",
