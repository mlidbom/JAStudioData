  "sourceMnemonic": "A <kanji>stop</kanji> that's just a <kanji>rest</kanji> (aka not permanent) isn't a straight up stop. You're planning on continuing again. That's why this is a <vocabulary>suspension</vocabulary>, or a <vocabulary>pause</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a fairly formal word, and it's often used when an activity or a service is temporarily suspended. For example, you could use it to talk about a pop band going on a hiatus or a machine suspending its operation.",
