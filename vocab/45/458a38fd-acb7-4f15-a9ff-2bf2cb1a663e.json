That's why this is a <vocabulary>suspension</vocabulary>, or a <vocabulary>pause</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a fairly formal word, and it's often used when an activity or a service is temporarily suspended. For example, you could use it to talk about a pop band going on a hiatus or a machine suspending its operation.",
