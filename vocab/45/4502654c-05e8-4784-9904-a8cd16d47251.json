  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "When a vocab is a single kanji and is alone it tends to use the kun'yomi reading. You learned the on'yomi reading for this kanji, so now it's time to learn the kun'yomi reading to learn this vocabulary word.\n\nWhat's <vocabulary>below</vocabulary> you? What's below your foot? Oh no. The worst thing possible: It's <ja><reading>した</reading></ja>.",
