  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a single kanji plus the hiragana <ja>るい</ja>. Words that end in <ja>い</ja> are usually adjectives, and this is no exception. What's the adjective form of <kanji>bright</kanji>? It's also <vocabulary>bright</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have to remember the <ja>あか</ja> portion. What is <ja>あか</ja> in Japanese? It is \"red.\" So, think of something that's really <vocabulary>bright</vocabulary>. Now, imagine it being totally red (aka <ja>あか</ja>). In Japan, the color red is associated with the sun, and the sun is pretty bright. If you can remember this you can also remember the reading of this word.",
