Here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nThe army said it would provide you with some <vocabulary>army provisions</vocabulary>. That's great! You go to the drop site where the provisions are, and you see the provisions. \"<reading>Heyo!</reading> It's <reading>roe</reading>!\" (<ja>ひょうろう</ja>) you say out loud. You're pretty happy that your provisions consist of tons and tons of roe!",
