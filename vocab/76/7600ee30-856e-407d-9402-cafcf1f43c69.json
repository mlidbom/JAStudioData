  "sourceMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana stuck in the middle you can guess that it is like putting two separate words that you've learned together into one word. This hiragana is <ja>の</ja>, a particle that makes something possessive. In this case, the <ja>子</ja> is of the <ja>女</ja>. Basically, this suggests that the woman is a child, aka a <vocabulary>girl</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since there's hiragana in here, you can bet that these kanji will use the kun'yomi readings. You already know the kun'yomi reading for <vocabulary>女</vocabulary>. The only thing I have to make sure that you know is <ja>子</ja>. When you need to remember the kun'yomi reading of <ja>子</ja>, just think about you fighting a child (you're a jerk, apparently!). When you hit her in the face, she flies to the floor, and the ref calls out \"<reading>KO</reading>!\" because you just knocked the poor kid out.",
