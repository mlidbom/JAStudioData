Both the kanji <ja>子</ja> and <ja>犬</ja> often favor kun'yomi readings, and this word is no exception. The reading for <ja>犬</ja> is the one you already know, and the reading for <ja>子</ja> as <ja>こ</ja> is a really common one (perhaps you've already learned that reading?). If not, just think about punching a puppy in the face, and giving it a <reading>KO</reading> (That's a knock out).",
