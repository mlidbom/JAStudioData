  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>times</kanji>. There's no good verb for the word \"times\" but you can probably imagine something doing something over and over and over again. What word would represent this? It would be <vocabulary>to revolve</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to go around</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to rotate</vocabulary>.\n\nBear in mind that this verb is intransitive, so it happens on its own. Something revolves or rotates, all by itself.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have a bag of walnuts that you're bringing to a friend's house but you trip and drop them all on the ground. You shout, \"<reading>Mah Wa</reading>lnuts! (<ja>まわ</ja>)\" as they start <vocabulary>to revolve</vocabulary> around you on the ground. Picture your walnuts going around you, getting all dirty.",
