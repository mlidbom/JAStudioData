You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Causing you <vocabulary>to leak</vocabulary> all over the floor (we're talking blood, here) is your friend <reading>Moe</reading> (<ja>も</ja>). If you know someone named Moe, imagine them doing this. If you don't, think of a famous Moe.",
