  "sourceMnemonic": "The moon kanji also represents a month, so when you have five of these months, what month of the year is it? That would be <vocabulary>May</vocabulary>, the greatest month of the year (because it has towel day in it!).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. <ja>月</ja> has two on'yomi readings, but it always uses the <ja>がつ</ja> reading in the names of the months, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember that:\n\n<vocabulary>May</vocabulary> is when you and your buddies get together to eat <reading>Go</reading>dzilla <reading>guts</reading> (<ja>ごがつ</ja>). You go hunting for Godzilla just for his delicious guts, and then eat them with your friends. Yummy.",
