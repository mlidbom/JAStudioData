  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>meet</kanji> so the verb form of that is <vocabulary>to meet</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to encounter</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have to remember the <ja>あ</ja> part but let's include the <ja>う</ja> as well for this one. Who do you want <vocabulary>to meet</vocabulary> more than anyone? Think about it. Then, imagine meeting them. The first thing they do is grab your arm and pinch it. You yell out \"<reading>OW</reading>!\" (<ja>あう</ja>) and they laugh and run away.",
