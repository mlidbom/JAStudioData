You could call it a <vocabulary>path</vocabulary> (you know, like a dirt path!) or a <vocabulary>dirt road</vocabulary>. Alternatively, another less traveled street that would probably be made out of dirt back in the day (before everything was paved) would be an <vocabulary>alley</vocabulary>. Imagine yourself walking down a dirt alley at night with no shoes. Scary!",
