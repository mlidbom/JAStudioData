  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>tolerance</kanji>, so the verb version is what happens when you're a really tolerant person. You're able <vocabulary>to relax</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to feel at home</vocabulary> because nothing really gets to you.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou want <vocabulary>to relax</vocabulary> so you go down to old <reading>coots ro</reading>ad (<ja>くつろ</ja>). It's a road with a bunch of old coots who don't bother nobody. They just kinda sit around and complain. That's where you like to relax. Something about being surrounded by a bunch of old coots on old coots road makes you feel at home.",
