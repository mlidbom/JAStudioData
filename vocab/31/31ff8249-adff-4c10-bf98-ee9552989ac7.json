  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Who are you going <vocabulary>to shoot</vocabulary>? You are going to shoot <reading>You</reading> (<ja>う</ja>). Why? Because there's another version of you in front of you, so if you don't shoot that version of you who is you, amirite?",
