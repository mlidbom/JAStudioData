  "sourceMnemonic": "<kanji>Someone</kanji> who <kanji>make</kanji>s is someone who creates things. Back in the day, a creator like this may have been known as many things, but the big one that stands out is an <vocabulary>author</vocabulary>.\n\nWondering about the difference between <ja>作者</ja> and <ja>作家</ja>? Basically, <ja>作者</ja> just refers to the creator of a particular creative work, such as a book, article, artwork, piece of music, etc., while <ja>作家</ja> refers to someone who creates those things as an occupation.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.
