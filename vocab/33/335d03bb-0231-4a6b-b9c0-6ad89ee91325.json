  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. You already learned that <ja>降りる</ja> means \"to get off.\" This is when you're helping something else descend down from something, not when you yourself are getting down. So it means <vocabulary>to take down</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to lower</vocabulary>.",
