  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nThe kanji <ja>外</ja> means <kanji>outside</kanji>, and the meaning of this verb is somewhat related. It means <vocabulary>to disconnect something</vocabulary>. Think of it like this, if you disconnect a plug from a socket, you are taking the plug \"outside\" of the socket, right? Depending on the context, this verb can also mean <vocabulary>to miss something</vocabulary> (like the target during archery practice), <vocabulary>to remove something</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to exclude something</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. You disconnect something, like a plug, or remove something, like your dog's leash. It's worth mentioning that most verbs ending in <ja>す</ja> are transitive, so you'll start seeing this pattern as you learn more!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be a kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this one yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf you're going <vocabulary>to disconnect something</vocabulary>, it <reading>has</reading> (<ja>はず</ja>) to be the right thing! Don't go disconnecting the wrong plug, you'll cause no end of trouble!",
