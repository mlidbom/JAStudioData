  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means \"stand\" and this means <vocabulary>to stand something up</vocabulary>. It also can mean <vocabulary>to make something</vocabulary>, both in a physical sense, like making a sound, and a mental sense, like making a plan. \n\nDon't confuse this with <ja>立つ</ja>. <ja>立てる</ja> means that you're standing something up. As in, \"I stood up the action figure\" or \"I will erect the flag.\" You're doing the action to something else.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have to remember the <ja>た</ja> portion. In order to do that, think of yourself standing up a huge sign. On it, written in big words:\n\"<reading>ta</reading> ta (<ja>た</ja>)!\"",
