  "sourceMnemonic": "What you <kanji>build</kanji> up in <kanji>front</kanji> of other people is your public image. This is your <vocabulary>public behavior</vocabulary>, how you act around others you don't really know. This concept is surprisingly important in Japan, so you'll hear it often enough despite being such a strange concept in other places. You'll have to think of this like you're building buildings of personality in front of you. These show off who you are on the outside, but it protects what's on the inside.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is pretty strange. It's a lot like <ja>建物</ja> in that it's read as <ja>たて</ja>, which is like the word <ja>建てる</ja> even though the <ja>て</ja> isn't showing here. So, you'll have to remember it's read like <ja>建てる</ja> but the <ja>て</ja> gets pushed into the kanji.",
