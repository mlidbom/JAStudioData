  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a lot like <ja>鳴く</ja>, which means \"to chirp\" (or some other animal noise). This has to do with noises too, but not so much animal and more like bells (including telephones). This word means <vocabulary>to ring</vocabulary>. If it helps, think of the <ja>る</ja> as a hint, kind of like the first sound of the word \"ring\" (<ja>る</ja>). So, <ja>る</ja> = \"ring\" and it's a verb, so <vocabulary>to ring</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading can come from <ja>鳴く</ja>. So long as you know the reading for that word you can know the reading for this word as well.",
