Basically, you have to put something down with this verb. It's a little different from the kanji meaning you learned but not that different.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Just imagine you're putting down <reading>O</reading>reos (<ja>お</ja>). One after another. Each oreo that you try <vocabulary>to put down</vocabulary> say in your head \"Hello Mr. Oreo, I'm going to put you down.. ooh yes, you like that don't you?\" REPEAT.",
