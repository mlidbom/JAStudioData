  "sourceMnemonic": "<ja>振る</ja> is \"to shake.\" <ja>仮名</ja> is kana. This word refers to <vocabulary>furigana</vocabulary>, which is the little kana that's put next to kanji for the people who don't use WaniKani and can't read anything. As to why it's called \"shake kana\"? I have no clue. Just imagine putting little kana next to kanji and watching them shake around, though, and you should be good to go.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The readings are <ja>振る</ja> and <ja>仮名</ja> put together into one. If you know those words, you won't need no furigana to help you with this word.",
