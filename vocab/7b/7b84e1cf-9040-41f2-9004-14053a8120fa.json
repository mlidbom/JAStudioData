You are transiting one object over to another person (the word is <vocabulary>to hand over</vocabulary>), though, so it kind of makes sense. You see the <ja>す</ja>? You're <reading>su</reading>ing somebody, so you hand over the papers telling them you're suing them. Don't confuse this with <ja>渡る</ja> which is \"to cross over.\" <ja>す</ja> is sue.",
