  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>carry</kanji> so the verb version is <vocabulary>to carry</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nImagine you have <vocabulary>to carry</vocabulary> a <reading>hawk</reading> (<ja>はこ</ja>). Imagine carrying it in your hands. It's trying to claw and peck itself free, but you don't let go. It is your job to carry this hawk with you everywhere. ",
