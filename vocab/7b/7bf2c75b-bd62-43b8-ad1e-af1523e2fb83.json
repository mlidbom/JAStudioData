  "sourceMnemonic": "When you <kanji>exit</kanji> and <kanji>come</kanji>, apparently it means <vocabulary>to be able to do</vocabulary>. I think of it like you're leaving a location (<ja>出</ja>) to do a task and then you come (<ja>来る</ja>) back after you did it. Perhaps you were waiting in a room training like someone from Dragonball. When you leave the room, you are ready to fight the enemy and win. You train in that room <vocabulary>to be able to do</vocabulary> whatever you need to do, and only leave and come back alive because you were able to do it.\n\nThis verb is really common and it has a wide range of meanings. It can also mean things like <vocabulary>to be ready</vocabulary>, for example a meal, and <vocabulary>to be made</vocabulary>, for example when saying what something is made from. It's commonly written in hiragana, but you'll see the kanji version too!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The readings are a bit strange. They're both kun'yomi readings, where <ja>出</ja> is <ja>で</ja> and <ja>来る</ja> is <ja>きる</ja>. This is different from the reading you originally learned with <ja>来る</ja> (<ja>くる</ja>), though, so be careful. If you can remember that and remember the kun'yomi readings from the previous vocab, you should be able to learn this one's reading as well.",
