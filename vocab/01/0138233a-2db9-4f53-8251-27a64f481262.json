  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>help</kanji> so the verb version is <vocabulary>to help</vocabulary>. Don't confuse this with <ja>助かる</ja> which means \"to be helped.\" You know that <ja>助ける</ja> is \"to help\" because you're doing the helping. You know that you're doing the helping because you <reading>care</reading> (<ja>ける</ja>).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou need <vocabulary>to help</vocabulary> someone. Someone is hanging off a cliff and out of reach. They ask you, the person standing above them, to <reading>toss</reading> (<ja>たす</ja>) them a rope, but you refuse. \"TOSS IT!\" they yell. \"I WILL NOT TOSS IT,\" you respond. You're a jerk.",
