  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>renew</kanji>, and this verb's meaning isn't far off. It's transitive, meaning it is done to something. What do you do if you renew something, usually to make it better? You're going <vocabulary>to change something</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to revise something</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to correct something</vocabulary>. This can also mean <vocabulary>to check something</vocabulary>, like train tickets, or the change you've been given.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWe all want <vocabulary>to change something</vocabulary>. Probably <reading>a lotta</reading> (<ja>あらた</ja>) things! Think about all the things you want to change. Your name? Your habits? Your plans? The rules? The government? I bet you can think of a lotta things you want to change.",
