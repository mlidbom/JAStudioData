You're trying <vocabulary>to defend against</vocabulary> something from happening. That's why this verb is a little weird and means <vocabulary>to defend</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to protect against</vocabulary>. It can also be <vocabulary>to prevent</vocabulary>, too, but just make sure you're thinking of it more like you're defending something with your prevention.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You want <vocabulary>to defend against</vocabulary> the enemy? You should probably put out that <reading>fuse</reading> (<ja>ふせ</ja>) attached to that giant bomb first then.",
