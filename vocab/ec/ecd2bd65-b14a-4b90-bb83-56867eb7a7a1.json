  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <ja>図</ja> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou <vocabulary>intentional</vocabulary>ly stub your <reading>toe</reading> (<ja>と</ja>) all the time! If you hurt your toe <vocabulary>on purpose</vocabulary> you can get out of class and work! It's a really simple injury, but you can't do other stuff while it's hurt, so you always do it on purpose to get out of things.",
