  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>add</kanji> and this word is the verb version of that: <vocabulary>to add</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a transitive verb, meaning that you are doing the adding to something else. You add a nose to your snowman, for example. ",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou decide <vocabulary>to add</vocabulary> something and then <vocabulary>to add</vocabulary> something else, and you end up with quite a <reading>qua</reading>ntity (<ja>くわ</ja>) of things. Just keep adding and adding forever. What a huge QUANTITY you now have!",
