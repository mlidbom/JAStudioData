  "sourceMnemonic": "<kanji>Doing</kanji> something as a <kanji>group</kanji> requires a <vocabulary>system</vocabulary>. Without some sort of <vocabulary>structure</vocabulary>, everyone does their own thing, and you would never be able to get stuff done as a group, you know?\n\n仕組み refers to the concept of a \"mechanism\" or \"system.\" It includes the underlying structure, organization, or framework that governs how something works or operates, highlighting its logic, order, and other often unseen things.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a word with an irregular combination of readings. 仕 uses its on'yomi reading, and 組 uses its kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember this unusual combination:\n\nTo be more successful in doing group assignments, you came up with a <vocabulary>system</vocabulary> called \"<reading>shee</reading>p <reading>cumi</reading>n (しくみ). Why \"sheep cumin\"? Sheep are known to be good team players (or herd players, should I say?), so you just sticked it to the name of the group you lead, the cumin group, hoping everyone can work together better, like sheep!",
