You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You want <vocabulary>to visit</vocabulary> your friend <reading>Taz</reading> (<ja>たず</ja>) the Tasmanian Devil. He's your best bro, so imagine visiting him and having a good time and saying you're going to visit him again.",
