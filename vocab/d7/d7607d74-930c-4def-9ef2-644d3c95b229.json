  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You go <vocabulary>to grasp</vocabulary> someone. You really need them. You are soooo <reading>needy</reading> (<ja>にぎ</ja>). Except, you can't really pronounce \"d\" sounds very well, so you say <ja><reading>にぎ</reading></ja>.",
