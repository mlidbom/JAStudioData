  "sourceMnemonic": "If you <kanji>decorate</kanji> your <kanji>spirit</kanji> with a bunch of pretty things like streamers and balloons, people will think you're just <vocabulary>showing off</vocabulary>. Yes, you know your spirit is awesome, but everyone else doesn't want it pushed in their face with your over the top decorations.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since the first part of this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You've learned how to read the かざ part already with the <ja>飾る</ja> vocabulary.\n\nThe second kanji uses the on'yomi reading. You didn't learn this reading for <ja>気</ja> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nAt the height of <vocabulary>showing off</vocabulary>, you bend one arm to your hip and the other out in the air. You pretend to be a <reading>ke</reading>ttle (<ja>け</ja>). You show off your spirit to all your friends singing \"I'm a little ke-ttle, short and stout. Here is my handle, here is my spout. EVERYONE LOOK HOW GREAT I AM!\" Your kettle dance is sure to impress them.",
