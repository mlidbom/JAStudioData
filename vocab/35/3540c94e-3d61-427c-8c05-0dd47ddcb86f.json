  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an <ja>い</ja> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>void</kanji>? It's <vocabulary>empty</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>vacant</vocabulary>. Just think of what has to happen to make a void in the first place.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nIf everything in life seems <vocabulary>empty</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>futile</vocabulary>, even cows will be affected. Listen to them say, \"<reading>Moo, nah</reading> (<ja>むな</ja>), never mind. What's the point?\" Nothing makes life seem empty like a cow saying \"Moo, nah.\"",
