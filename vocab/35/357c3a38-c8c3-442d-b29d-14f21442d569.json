  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\nImagine a giant <vocabulary>heart</vocabulary> sitting in a rowing boat. It's also drinking cocoa. Focus on all three of these parts and associate them into one story / memory. Once you've done that, sing the \"<reading>cocoa row</reading>\" (<ja>こころ</ja>) song! I don't know what that song is, but I want you to make one up and actually sing it, out loud. If you do, I bet you won't forget this word's reading too easily.",
