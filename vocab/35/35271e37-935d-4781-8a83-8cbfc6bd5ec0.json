  "sourceMnemonic": "The combination of kanji doesn't make perfect sense, but it's alright. Take something that's <kanji>middle</kanji> <kanji>old</kanji> and you have something that's <vocabulary>used</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>secondhand</vocabulary>. It's not 100% old yet... it's still in the middle, meaning you can give it to someone else to use, like your younger siblings.",
