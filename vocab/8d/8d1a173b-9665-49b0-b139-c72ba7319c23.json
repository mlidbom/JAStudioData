  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThe entire world would start <vocabulary>to die out</vocabulary> if there were no <reading>coo</reading>kies (<ja>く</ja>) left! Can you imagine your life without cookies? The trees and animals would all die too. Because they love cookies. Not just us humans.",
