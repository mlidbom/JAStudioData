  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>replace</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to replace</vocabulary>. You know that you're doing the replacing because of the <reading>air</reading> (<ja>える</ja>). You're replacing the air as quickly as you can because if you don't you wouldn't be able to breathe in this small room.",
