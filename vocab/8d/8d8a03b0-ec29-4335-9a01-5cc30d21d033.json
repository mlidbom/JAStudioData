Just in case, you know... that would be the <vocabulary>toilet</vocabulary>. You might also call it the <vocabulary>lavatory</vocabulary>, the <vocabulary>restroom</vocabulary>, or the <vocabulary>bathroom</vocabulary>.\n\nThis word is casual and sounds gruff, so you won't see it on offical signs or hear it in polite conversation. It's worth knowing so that you'll understand it in casual speaking and writing, though.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just watch out for the rendaku. ",
