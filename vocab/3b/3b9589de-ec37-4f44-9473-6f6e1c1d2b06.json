  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses kun'yomi instead of on'yomi readings, because <ja>初</ja> behaves more like a prefix here. You already know how to read <ja>耳</ja>, but you haven't learned the kun'yomi for <ja>初</ja> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:\n\nWhatever it is, this <vocabulary>something heard for the first time</vocabulary>, be sure to hold onto your <reading>hats</reading> (<ja>はつ</ja>)! It's going to be something big, and I'm pretty sure it's going to be <vocabulary>news</vocabulary> to me, too.",
