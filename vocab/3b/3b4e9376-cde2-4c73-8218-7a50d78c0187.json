  "sourceMnemonic": "The <ja>ご</ja> just makes this word more polite and fancy. When it comes to food, it's nice to be those things. This has the same meaning as the kanji (<kanji>meal</kanji>) making it <vocabulary>meal</vocabulary>, but it also refers to <vocabulary>cooked rice</vocabulary> as well. So, \"Come eat your <ja>ご飯</ja>\" can be both \"come eat your rice\" and \"come eat your meal.\" Really, since most Japanese meals come with rice, though, you can see how the overlap happens.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Now how about you \"<reading>han</reading>d\" me another bowl of rice?",
