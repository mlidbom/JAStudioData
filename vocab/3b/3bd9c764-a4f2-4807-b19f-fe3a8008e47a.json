You'll have to learn it straight up, that is, unless you know the word <ja>おいしい</ja> already, which many people do as it's used in every other sentence in every Japanese variety show. If you don't know this word already, just think of yourself eating something <vocabulary>delicious</vocabulary>. It's so delicious it makes you mad, I have no idea why. You yell at the chef: \"<reading>OI</reading> (<ja>おい</ja>). OI! WHY IS THIS SO DELICIOUS????\"",
