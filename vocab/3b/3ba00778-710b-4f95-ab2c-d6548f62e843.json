  "sourceMnemonic": "<ja>この</ja> means \"this\", and you know what the word <ja>前</ja>  means (front/before). The combination of these words, \"this before\" if you will, can mean a few different things. If we're talking about when something happened, the \"before\" meaning kicks in, and it means <vocabulary>the other day</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>recently</vocabulary>. If we're talking about location, then the \"front\" meaning kicks in, and it means <vocabulary>in front of this</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading for <ja>前</ja> is the kun'yomi, like the reading for the vocabulary word <ja>前</ja>. So long as you know that word, you'll be able to read this one too. The reason it's not on'yomi is because it's like two words put together. The word <ja>この</ja> and the word <ja>前</ja>.",
