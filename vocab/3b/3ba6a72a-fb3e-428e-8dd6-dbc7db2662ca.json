  "sourceMnemonic": "<kanji>Stand</kanji>ing and <kanji>enter</kanji>ing are both <ja>禁止</ja> (prohibited). If you see this sign, it's essentially saying <vocabulary>do not enter</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>no entry</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading for <ja>立入</ja> is a bit strange, but it might help you to know that it can also be written <ja>立ち入り</ja>. The <ja>立ち</ja> is the same one you learned with <ja>立ち飲み</ja> and the <ja>入り</ja> is the reading you learned with <ja>入り口</ja>. In our version of the word, the hiragana isn't visible (it's sort of pushed into the kanji), but the word is still pronounced the same way: <ja>たちいり</ja>.\n\nAnd <ja>禁止</ja> doesn't have any weirdness going on, so at least you have that!",
