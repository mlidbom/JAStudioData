  "sourceMnemonic": "If you're <kanji>anti-</kanji> something in a way that's <kanji>different</kanji> from the norm then you'll be in <vocabulary>violation</vocabulary> of the law! The laws that the \"not\" different people made. Either way, those people will give you a hard time for your anti-stance against the thing they like, and say it's a <vocabulary>transgression</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <ja>違</ja> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf you find yourself in <vocabulary>violation</vocabulary> of the law just pull out your pet <reading>ea</reading>gle (<ja>い</ja>). Eagles are so majestic, they'll forget all about your transgression and let you go. If you're going to go be anti-something make sure you bring that eagle. People seem to care more about animals than other people like that.",
