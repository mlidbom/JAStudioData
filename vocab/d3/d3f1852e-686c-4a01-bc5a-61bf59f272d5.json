Have you seen \"Iron Chef?\" The Japanese translation is <ja>料理の鉄人</ja>, which means \"Chef Iron Man\" aka \"Chef Badass,\" at least in my book.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since <ja>人</ja> has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\n\nCheck out the <vocabulary>strong man</vocabulary> wearing nothing but <reading>jean</reading>s (<ja>じん</ja>). He looks like a badass in his jeans, flexing his pecs. Very impressive, but also slightly terrifying.",
