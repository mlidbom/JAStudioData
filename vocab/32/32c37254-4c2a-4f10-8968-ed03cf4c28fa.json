  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>permit</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to permit</vocabulary>. It also means <vocabulary>to forgive</vocabulary>, in that \"I'll permit it this time... but only this time.\" Look out for <ja>許さない</ja> in TV shows, too. It means \"I won't permit this!\" or \"I won't forgive you!\"",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: I'm going to allow it. <reading>You're</reading> (<ja>ゆる</ja>) allowed to do it this one time, okay?",
