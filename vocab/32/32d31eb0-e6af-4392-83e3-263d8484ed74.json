  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\nDo you know the word \"Kamikaze\"? Also, do you remember the word <ja>風</ja> from a previous level? Kamikaze means \"divine winds\" or \"godly winds.\" If you know the word \"Kamikaze\" you can apply it to this single word, that means \"god\" or \"gods.\" Use your prior knowledge to remember this reading.",
