  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nThe most <vocabulary>coarse</vocabulary> thing you can think of is <reading>a ro</reading>ck (<ja>あら</ja>). You rubbed it on your face and it was really <vocabulary>rough</vocabulary> and kinda painful. You probably shouldn't be rubbing a rock on your face, actually.",
