  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "You have to remember the <ja>た</ja> portion if you want to be able to read this word, which uses the kun'yomi reading. Think about yourself <vocabulary>eat</vocabulary>ing some <reading>ta</reading>cos (<ja>た</ja>). Imagine yourself eating it, that raw beef taste in your mouth (either like it or hate it).",
