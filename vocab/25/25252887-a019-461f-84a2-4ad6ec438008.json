You should make sure you don't mix them up. The first one is the reading you learned with the kanji. <ja>かく</ja> means <vocabulary>angle</vocabulary>.\n\nThe second reading (<ja>かど</ja>), is something you haven't learned, and it means <vocabulary>corner</vocabulary>. Just picture a deck of <reading>card</reading>s (<ja>かど</ja>). Now take one card at a time and fold them to make a <vocabulary>corner</vocabulary>. Now tape those cards into all the corners of your house. Why? Because it's artsy!",
