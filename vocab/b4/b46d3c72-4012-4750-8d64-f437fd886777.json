  "sourceMnemonic": "Since the kanji <ja>月</ja> mean both moon and month (because a moon cycle is about a month, presumably), what is the number one month? In English we have an actual name for it, and that name is <vocabulary>January</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. <ja>月</ja> has two on'yomi readings, but it always uses the <ja>がつ</ja> reading in the names of the months, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember that:\n\n<vocabulary>January</vocabulary> always gives you <reading>itchy</reading> <reading>guts</reading> (<ja>いちがつ</ja>). It's a weird affliction that comes around every January and makes your guts incredibly itchy. Probably due to all that overindulgence over the new year.\n",
