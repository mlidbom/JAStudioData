  "sourceMnemonic": "You've hopefully already learned that <ja>力</ja> means \"power\". You might have also heard the word <ja>いっぱい</ja>, because it's used a lot in conversation. It has a few meanings (you'll learn more of them later) but the important one here is \"full\" or \"a lot\". Put these two words together and you have <vocabulary>full power</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>with all one’s strength</vocabulary>, and <vocabulary>as hard as one can</vocabulary>. Remember this one with all your strength!\n\nJust a side note: <ja>いっぱい</ja> can also be written in kanji, which you'll learn later on! However, in simple words like this one it's usually written in kana.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "<ja>力</ja> uses the same reading as you learned with the vocabulary. That's because this is basically two separate words stuck together.",
