  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>release</kanji> and the verb vocab version means <vocabulary>to be released</vocabulary>. You can differentiate this one from <ja>放す</ja> (to release) by thinking that it's pretty <reading>rare</reading> (<ja>れる</ja>) for you to be released by your arch nemesis. He just let you go, strangely. How rare.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading comes from <ja>放す</ja>. As long as you know that word you can apply that reading over here as well.",
