And since <ja>日</ja> has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember this reading:\n\n<vocabulary>How many days</vocabulary> does it take you to bake a <reading>naan</reading> <reading>Nietzsche</reading> (<ja>なんにち</ja>)? It's not easy to make a Nietzsche entirely out of naan, so I wonder how many days it would take.",
