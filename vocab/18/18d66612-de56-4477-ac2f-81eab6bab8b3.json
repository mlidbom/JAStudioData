  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The readings are both kun'yomi vocab readings, probably because a <ja>鼻</ja> is a body part, and body parts do that to jukugo words. You know <ja>鼻</ja>'s reading from the kanji (<ja>はな</ja>) and you know <ja>歌</ja>'s reading from the vocabulary word <ja>歌</ja> (<ja>うた</ja>). Combine them together and you have a very nice humming tune and reading, <ja>はなうた</ja>.",
