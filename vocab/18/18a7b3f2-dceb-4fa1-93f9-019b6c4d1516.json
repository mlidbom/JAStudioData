  "sourceMnemonic": "This word is the kanji <kanji>same</kanji> with hiragana attached, and it also means <vocabulary>same</vocabulary>.\n\nIt's a bit of an oddball among Japanese adjectives, because you don't need な or い to attach it to a noun. So it's usually considered to be a \"special\" な-adjective. Have a look at the context sentences to see it in action!",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nWhen you think of the word \"same\" think <vocabulary>same</vocabulary> <reading>owner</reading> (<ja>おな</ja>). You're looking at a restaurant that has a sign that says, \"New owners!\" However, when you walk in you see it's the same terrible owner you remember from before. What a liar.",
