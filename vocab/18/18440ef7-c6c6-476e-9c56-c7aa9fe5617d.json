  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>support</kanji> so the verb version is <vocabulary>to support</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou need <vocabulary>to support</vocabulary> someone. In order to support them, you grab two saws. One saw and another saw. It's a <reading>saw saw</reading> (<ja>ささ</ja>) combination good enough to do all the supporting you need - and maybe cut some supports too.",
