  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an <ja>い</ja> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>frugal</kanji>? It's <vocabulary>regrettable</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>precious</vocabulary>. If you're too frugal to buy something your actions are regrettable later when you realize you wanted that thing. If you're so frugal you only buy one single thing, it's very precious to you.",

You haven't learned this reading yet so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou made a <vocabulary>regrettable</vocabulary> decision. You didn't buy that clock you wanted and now it's been discontinued. The salesperson tells you this and all you can say is, \"<reading>Oh</reading>...\" (<ja>お</ja>) really really quietly. How <vocabulary>disappointing</vocabulary>.",
