  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>obstruct</kanji>, so what is the verb vocab version? It's <vocabulary>to obstruct</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou try <vocabulary>to obstruct</vocabulary> a woman coming your way (see kanji). As she gets close, she roars, \"I am <reading>Sama(n)tha</reading>!\" (<ja>さまた</ja>) You shall let me pass!\" You don't argue with Samanthas. Get out of her way! ",
