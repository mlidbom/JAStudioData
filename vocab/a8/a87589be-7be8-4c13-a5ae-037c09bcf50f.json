  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>spinning</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to spin</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to make yarn</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nBefore you start <vocabulary>to spin</vocabulary> you have to let out <reading>two moo</reading>s (<ja>つむ</ja>) as tribute to the cows that gave you their fur <vocabulary>to make yarn</vocabulary> out of. Go on, two moos, right now. Hey, out loud, not in your head!",
