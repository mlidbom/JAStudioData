  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb.\n\nThe kanji <ja>加</ja> means <kanji>add</kanji>, and this verb means <vocabulary>to be added to</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to join in</vocabulary>.\n\nIt is an intransitive verb, like most verbs ending in <ja>わる</ja>. That means that it happens by itself, or at least the cause of the adding is not you. Something gets added to something else, perhaps by magic?",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.\n\nLucky for you, the kanji readings for transitive and intransitive verbs are almost always the same. Once you learn one, you know them both! This reading is the same as <ja>加える</ja>. To help you distinguish between the two, remember that most verbs ending in <ja>わる</ja> are intransitive.",
