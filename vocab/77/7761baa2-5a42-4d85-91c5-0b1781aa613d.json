  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>extinguish</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to extinguish something</vocabulary>. You can also use this word to say <vocabulary>to erase something</vocabulary>, like data, and <vocabulary>to turn something off</vocabulary>, like the lights or the power. Technically you're extinguishing the data, as well as the lights or power, right?",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nThe <reading>ke</reading>ttle is getting too hot so it catches on fire. You have to extinguish the flames before your house burns down too, just because of this stupid little kettle.",
