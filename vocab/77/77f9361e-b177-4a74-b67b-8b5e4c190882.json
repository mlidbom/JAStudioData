  "sourceMnemonic": "Before you can give an <kanji>explanation</kanji> of who you are to someone you're about to <kanji>meet</kanji>, you have to <vocabulary>nod</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>bow</vocabulary> as a <vocabulary>greeting</vocabulary> first. It's rude to start explaining who you are before you greet them.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <ja>会</ja> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nWhen someone <vocabulary>bow</vocabulary>s to you, you always feel a little uncomfortable, so you say, \"<reading>Eh</reading>\" (<ja>え</ja>) and try to get them to stop. You're so uncomfortable that you can't think of words and \"eh\" is all you can manage to get out.",
