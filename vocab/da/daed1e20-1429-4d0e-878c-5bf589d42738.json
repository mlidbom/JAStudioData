  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>copy</kanji>, but what is a copy? It is basically a photograph, which is why this word means <vocabulary>to be photographed</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to be in a photograph</vocabulary>. You know this one is \"to be photographed\" because it ends with a <ja>る</ja>. Someone thinks you're \"<reading>ru</reading>de\" so they're photographing you.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have to remember the <ja>うつ</ja> part. You're being rude, right? That's why you got photographed. Why are you rude? You're doing beatboxing, constantly saying <ja>うつうつうつ</ja> over and over again. Say it out loud, too.",
