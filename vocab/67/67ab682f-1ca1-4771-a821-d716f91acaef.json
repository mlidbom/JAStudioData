  "sourceMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. That being said, this can also mean <vocabulary>difficult</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>painful</vocabulary> as well. I guess if you're in a spicy situation it's going to be a difficult one.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Depending on the context, the reading for this word could be <ja>からい</ja> or <ja>つらい</ja>. The <ja>からい</ja> reading is the spicy one, you can remember that because that <vocabulary>spicy</vocabulary> feeling comes from (<ja>から</ja>) your mouth. The <ja>つらい</ja> reading is the <vocabulary>difficult</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>painful</vocabulary> one. You can remember this because <reading>two Ra</reading>s (<ja>つら</ja>) are way more difficult to deal with than one Ra.",
