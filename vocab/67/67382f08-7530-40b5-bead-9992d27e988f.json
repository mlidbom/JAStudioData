The kanji itself means <kanji>talk</kanji> so the verb version of this is <vocabulary>to talk</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to speak</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nEvery time you try <vocabulary>to speak</vocabulary>, <ja>花</ja>s (<ja>はな</ja>) just sprout out of your mouth preventing you. Imagine your mouth full of flowers. Taste them, spit them out, and try to speak again. Same problem.",
