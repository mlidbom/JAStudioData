And don't blame Japanese people for it either.\n\nSo apparently a <kanji>stupid</kanji> <kanji>Chinese</kanji> person is a <vocabulary>molester</vocabulary>. Our theory is, that in China \"Chinese\" just meant \"person\" so a molester was just a stupid person. But in Japanese we think of <ja>漢</ja> as Chinese, so there you go. Either way, you'll probably never ever forget this one. You're welcome!",
