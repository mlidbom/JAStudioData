  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>mix</kanji> so the verb version is <vocabulary>to mix something</vocabulary>. \n\nThere are similar words to this one, including <ja>交じる</ja> which means \"to be mixed\" and <ja>交わる</ja> which means \"to intersect.\" This one is when you're doing the mixing. It's transitive. Like <ja>交じる</ja>, the connotation is that the things being mixed are distinguishable from each other, like two types of fish, or books being mixed together. They don't become homogenous like paint or something would.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou have to remember the <ja>ま</ja> portion. Who would mix things for you (like cakes and other goodies) growing up? That would be your <reading>Ma</reading> (<ja>ま</ja>).",
