  "sourceMnemonic": "This is the adverb version of <kanji>未</kanji>, so it means the same thing: <vocabulary>not yet</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>still</vocabulary>, depending on the context.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn it with this kanji, so here a mnemonic to help you:\n\nSomeone's telling you \"<vocabulary>not yet</vocabulary>... not yet.... not yet...\". You have some food on your nose, but you're not allowed to eat it <reading>今</reading> (いま).\n\nNote that this word can also be read まだ. However, いまだ is often written in kanji, while まだ is almost always written in kana. So when you see 未だ, it's a safe bet to read it as いまだ!",
