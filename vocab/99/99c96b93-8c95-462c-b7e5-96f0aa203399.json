  "sourceMnemonic": "The <kanji>times</kanji> when you are in <kanji>mourning</kanji> each year are for a loved one's <vocabulary>death anniversary</vocabulary>. They come around again every year. It's important you remember your loved ones at this time.\n\nYou'll often see this used with a number before <ja>回忌</ja>, indicating a certain anniversary. However, you actually start counting your <ja>回忌</ja> starting with the first period of mourning around the time of the person's death, which would be the <ja>一回忌</ja>. Hence, <ja>二回忌</ja> would usually be translated as \"first death anniversary\", <ja>三回忌</ja> as \"second death anniversary\", and so on. ",
