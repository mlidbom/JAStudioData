  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. You already learned that <ja>通る</ja> means to pass, but this is a little different. You aren't the one passing, Sue (<ja>す</ja>) is. So you have to let Sue pass. In other words, this verb is transitive, meaning it has an object. That's why it means <vocabulary>to let something pass</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to put something through</vocabulary>.\n\nThe way this verb is translated into English changes a lot depending on the noun it's paired with. For example <ja>火を通す</ja> is literally \"to let the fire pass through\", and means \"to heat through\". <ja>針に糸を通す</ja> is literally \"to put thread through a needle\", so means \"to thread a needle\".",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned <ja>通る</ja>. Switch the <ja>る</ja> for a <ja>す</ja> and you'll be all set!",
