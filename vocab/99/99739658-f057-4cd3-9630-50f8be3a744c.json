  "sourceMnemonic": "To <kanji>support</kanji> yourself to some <kanji>degree</kanji>, you need <vocabulary>preparation</vocabulary>. Doing your hair and makeup in the morning supports your presentation to some extent, right? \n\nThis is another word for \"preparation\" besides <ja>準備</ja> and <ja>用意</ja>. They’re all similar, but <ja>支度</ja> is usually used in personal contexts, such as <ja>身支度</ja> (getting dressed) or <ja>旅支度</ja> (getting ready for a trip).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <ja>度</ja> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember them together:\n\nIn <vocabulary>preparation</vocabulary> for getting sheared, a <reading>shee</reading>p will sit on a <reading>tack</reading> (<ja>したく</ja>). This sheep tacking makes it so that the shearing part is nothing! Imagine watching some sheep <vocabulary>getting ready</vocabulary> by sitting on tacks. Yikes. You want to tell them being sheared doesn't hurt and that sheep tacking is worse, but something makes you think they won't listen to you.",
