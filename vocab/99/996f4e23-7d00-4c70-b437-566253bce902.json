  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \n\nYou're part of a special <vocabulary>group</vocabulary>. It is the <reading>cumi</reading>n group, and they deal with all things cumin (the spice / seed). Smell the cumin. Touch it. Taste it. You live and breathe the stuff, because you are the president of this cumin group.\n\nP.S. This can also be spelled <ja>組み</ja> (same overall reading: <ja>くみ</ja>).",
