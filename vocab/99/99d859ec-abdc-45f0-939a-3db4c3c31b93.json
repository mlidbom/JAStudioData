You have <ja>混む</ja> (To Be Crowded), <ja>混ぜる</ja> (to mix), <ja>混ざる</ja> (to get mixed), and now this: <ja>混じる</ja>, <vocabulary>To Get Mixed Up In</vocabulary>. It makes sense because it has to do with mixing, but how to differentiate from the rest? Well, for this one just imagine <reading>Je</reading>sus (<ja>じ</ja>) getting mixed up in a pot of soup. He's getting mixed up in this giant pot of soup because someone thinks that if they eat him, they'll gain his powers.",
