  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>finish</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to finish something</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to end something</vocabulary>.\n\nThis is a transitive verb, meaning you finish something, like a long day at work!\n\nYou need to differentiate this from <ja>終わる</ja>, which is when something just ends on its own. <ja>終える</ja> is about when you make something end. Remember it like this: Canadians always end their sentences with \"eh\" <ja>え</ja>, right? Well that's how you know they're ending their sentence. Just listen for the \"eh,\" eh?",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou finally finished your school project. \"Oh, A!\" (<ja>おえ</ja>) you say to yourself, as though you can grade your own project. ",
