  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an <ja>い</ja> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>pure</kanji>? It's also <vocabulary>pure</vocabulary>. People like this are also usually really <vocabulary>gracious</vocabulary> to others. This type of pure heart would even be a gracious loser.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Oh man, the reading for this is... like... crazy. First part can be something like <reading>it's soggy</reading> (<ja>いさぎ</ja>)... then the second part is like the word <ja>良い</ja> (good). So, you can think of a pure hearted person eating soggy cereal. He/she is so pure hearted that it doesn't matter to them how soggy it is. In fact, they seem to enjoy it! They keep saying \"<reading>it's soggy, good!\"</reading> over and over again while eating the terribly soggy food.",
