  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is double kun'yomi (body parts tend to make kanji in words change to a kun'yomi reading). Both kanji in this word had you learn that reading right from the start, though, so you should be able to read this word. Just watch out for the rendaku making it <ja>がみ</ja>, not <ja>かみ</ja>.",
