  "sourceMnemonic": "A <kanji>language</kanji> about <kanji>thing</kanji>s. This is a confusing one. Just think of it more like someone talking about things, anything, really. Someone who just talks about things is someone who tells stories. So, this word means <vocabulary>tale</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>story</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>legend</vocabulary> (not the Tom Cruise one, though).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Both kanji take the kun'yomi here. For <ja>物</ja>, that's <ja>もの</ja>, which you learned with the vocabulary <ja>物</ja>. You learned the kun'yomi for <ja>語</ja> with the verb <ja>語</ja>る, but here it becomes <ja>がたり</ja> because of rendaku, and the <ja>り</ja> is tucked inside the kanji.\n\nMaybe you've already heard the word <ja>ものがたり</ja> too. It's in some film and book names. If you haven't, and you find this reading hard to remember, think of a story about an infamous <reading>Gatling</reading> (<ja>がたり</ja>) gun that wandered the land, mowing everything down in its path. It's a terrible legend, but what if it were true???",
