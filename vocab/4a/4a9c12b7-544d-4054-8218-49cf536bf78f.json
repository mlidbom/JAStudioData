  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This word is actually two separate words combined with a particle. So, since you treat them like separate words, you read each of them with the kun'yomi readings (they are both single kanji words all alone). That being said, in level 4 you learned about the vocab readings for these separate words, so use that knowledge to remember the reading for this word as well.",
