  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: When it comes to <vocabulary>pipe</vocabulary>s, you always want to have two sets of two of them, just in case. So, that's a <reading>two two</reading> (<ja>つつ</ja>) set of pipes, lined up next to each other for backup.",
