  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading for this is pretty weird. <ja>計</ja> is all nice and normal, but <ja>時</ja> is <ja>と</ja> for some reason. It probably is coming from the vocab word <ja>時</ja> (<ja>とき</ja>), is my guess. But even if it is, it's shortened, making it a step more complicated. Maybe it's just better to imagine that your <vocabulary>watch</vocabulary> is a walky <reading>talky</reading> (<ja>とけい</ja>) and run with that?",
