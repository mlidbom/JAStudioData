  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>earthquake</kanji> so the verb means <vocabulary>to shiver</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>to shake</vocabulary>, like you would if there was an earthquake happening right now.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou start <vocabulary>to shake</vocabulary> in an earthquake because you're really <reading>full</reading> (<ja>ふる</ja>) from eating lunch. Now your full belly is shaking and quaking with the ground! Ahh it's awful! You never want to be full again!",
