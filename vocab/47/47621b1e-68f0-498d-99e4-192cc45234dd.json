  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>stretch</kanji>, and the verb version means&nbsp;<vocabulary>to stretch over something</vocabulary>, <vocabulary>to spread out</vocabulary>, or <vocabulary>to be taut</vocabulary>, not to be confused with the type of stretching you do after a workout.\n\nThis word is both transitive and intransitive. When it follows <ja>を</ja>, it emphasizes the physical act of extending something over an area, like stretching a canvas over a frame, unfurling a sail on a ship, or roping off a crime scene. When following <ja>が</ja>, it expresses the resulting state of having been stretched or spread, like a bloated stomach, a swollen muscle, or a spider web.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nImagine yourself trying <vocabulary>to stretch</vocabulary> your favorite toy figurine, seeing just how far you can stretch it. With every stretch, you start laughing uncontrollably, <reading>HA</reading> (<ja>は</ja>) HA HA HA HA HA. Seems a bit cruel. Are you okay?",
