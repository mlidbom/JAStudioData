You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Look at this <reading>cooler</reading> (<ja>くら</ja>). Now look at this other cooler. We need <vocabulary>to  compare</vocabulary> the two coolers. Think about all the features each one has and really compare, like you have a list or something.",
