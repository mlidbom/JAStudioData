  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>foster</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to foster</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to raise</vocabulary>. This can also refer to fostering a skill or ability, so can also mean <vocabulary>to develop</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to cultivate</vocabulary>. ",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're offering <vocabulary>to raise</vocabulary> some girl as your own. After the paperwork is over, you can finally say: \"<reading>Yah, she now</reading> (<ja>やしな</ja>) is my kid!\"",
