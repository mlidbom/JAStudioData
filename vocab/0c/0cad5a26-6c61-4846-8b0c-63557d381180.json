  "sourceMnemonic": "When you have <kanji>romance</kanji> you also have <vocabulary>love</vocabulary>! The romantic kind of mushy, gushy love. Be careful though. This word doesn't share its meaning with its kanji. But, that's how romance is. It gets all crazy and turns to love really fast.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: Your <vocabulary>love</vocabulary> isn't toward a person, it's toward this giant <reading>Koi</reading> (<ja>こい</ja>) fish you met the other day. The fish is just so... so... handsome! You get hearts popping above your head every time you think about this koi!",
