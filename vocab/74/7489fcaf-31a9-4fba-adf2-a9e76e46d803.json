  "sourceMnemonic": "When a vocab is a single kanji all alone, it usually has the same meaning as its kanji parent. That goes for this vocab word as well. <kanji>Person</kanji> is <vocabulary>person</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "When a vocab is a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji), it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Since you don't know the kun'yomi reading for this kanji yet, let's use a mnemonic to learn it.\n\nWhat does a <vocabulary>person</vocabulary> hate more than anything? They hate extreme <reading>heat</reading> (<ja>ひと</ja>). You can always put on more clothes to stay warm, but when the heat gets too high, you can only take off so much.",
