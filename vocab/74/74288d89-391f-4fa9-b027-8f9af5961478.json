  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. It's made up of the kanji for <kanji>see</kanji> and <kanji>right</kanji>, so what happens when you see the right thing? You manage <vocabulary>to come upon</vocabulary> what you're looking for or <vocabulary>to be found</vocabulary>, if you're the one who's lost and you see the right people that are looking for you.\n\nNote: This verb is almost always used in the negative form. It is very, very rare for it to be positive. So when you're using it, make sure no one found the thing you're talking about!",
