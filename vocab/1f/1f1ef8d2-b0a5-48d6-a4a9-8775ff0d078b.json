  "sourceMnemonic": "This word is made up of a single kanji with hiragana attached to it. That hiragana ends with <ja>い</ja> which means it's an adjective. So, what's the adjective form of the kanji that's in this word? <ja>円</ja> means both \"yen\" and \"round\" but in this case we're looking at the round one (because something isn't going to be \"yenny\"). The adjective version of round is <vocabulary>round</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>circular</vocabulary>. Just like a yen coin, this \"round\" is a flat round. As in, if you draw a circle on a piece of paper, you could use this word. Same goes with yen, which is why \"yen\" and \"round\" both use the same kanji.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThe reading for the <ja>円</ja> portion of this word is the same as a kanji you're learning in this level: <ja>丸</ja>. That kanji means something really similar to this kanji. And guess what? They also share a reading. So, if you know that the reading of <ja>丸</ja> is <ja>まる</ja> then you'll also know that the reading for this word is <ja><reading>まる</reading></ja>!",
