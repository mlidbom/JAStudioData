So, with that in mind, a <kanji>photograph</kanji> <kanji>shadow</kanji> was someone doing a <vocabulary>photoshoot</vocabulary> of some kind. And, in even more modern times, it has become a <vocabulary>movie shoot</vocabulary> as well. More simply, it can be <vocabulary>photographing</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>filming</vocabulary> as well. Basically, if it has to do with taking photos or video, <ja>撮影</ja> is your dude.",
