The kanji itself means <kanji>sick</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to be sick</vocabulary>. It can also be used as <vocabulary>to come down with</vocabulary> when you have the flu or some other illness.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nThere is only one time you allow yourself <vocabulary>to be sick</vocabulary>, and that's when the <reading>Ya</reading>nkees (<ja>や</ja>) are playing. You can't miss any games so you just happen <vocabulary>to fall ill</vocabulary> whenever they're playing so you can stay home and watch. That's pretty convenient, isn't it?",
