  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>closed</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to close</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou need <vocabulary>to close</vocabulary> the door or the <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>) will come in. Not just one sheep, or two, but hundreds of sheep. They'll see you didn't manage <vocabulary>to shut</vocabulary> that door properly, and when you turn around your house will be covered floor to ceiling with fat squishy sheep.",
