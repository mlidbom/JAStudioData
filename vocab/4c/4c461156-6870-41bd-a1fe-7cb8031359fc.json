  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. \n\nThe kanji itself means <kanji>lack</kanji>, and this verb simply means <vocabulary>to lack something</vocabulary>.\n\nIt's a transitive verb. That means that it takes a direct object. You lack something. Like a car, concentration, or a soul. This is different from <ja>欠ける</ja>, which happens all by itself.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "You learned this reading when you learned <ja>欠ける</ja>, but here's a mnemonic just in case:\n\nYou never know when you're going <vocabulary>to lack something</vocabulary>. Like a <reading>ca</reading>r (<ja>か</ja>). Did you plan for it to break? NO! But it happened and now you lack a car in a big way. Not <reading>cool</reading> (<ja>く</ja>)!",
