  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "You haven't seen this reading for <ja>下</ja> yet (sorry there's so many for this kanji!) so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nThose items are so <vocabulary>crude</vocabulary> that you can't even tell what they're supposed to be. Honestly they all just look like statues of lumpy <reading>ge</reading>ckos (<ja>げ</ja>). That says it's a lamp but it looks more like a gecko looking at the sky. That chair? Definitely a bunch of geckos having a pool party. Are you sure you didn't get this stuff from a weird gecko artist?",
