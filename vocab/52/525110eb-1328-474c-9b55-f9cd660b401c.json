  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: \n\nYou're staring really closely at this <vocabulary>deer</vocabulary>, but something looks off. You get closer, slowly, and you realize it's a <reading>shee</reading>p in a <reading>ca</reading>r (<ja>しか</ja>) shaped like a deer. The sheep car deer suddenly turns toward you rushing forward, legs raised. Ahh, get outta there! (The lesson here is to never get too close to a deer. You never know its true form until it's too late.)",
