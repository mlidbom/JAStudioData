  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>recommend</kanji> so the verb vocab version is <vocabulary>to recommend</vocabulary>. This word is often used in a positive context for recommending things, actions, and people by implying or pointing out their charms and/or merits.\n\nAlthough <ja>薦める</ja> and <ja>勧める</ja> are similar, there are subtle differences between the two. <ja>勧める</ja> is often used to suggest that someone perform a specific action, often as friendly advice or encouragement. It can also be used when offering something, such as a drink. On the other hand, <ja>薦める</ja> is used to recommend a person or thing as suitable for a particular situation, with a focus on endorsing the subject rather than a specific action.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This has the same reading as <ja>勧める</ja>, since they mean almost the same thing.",
