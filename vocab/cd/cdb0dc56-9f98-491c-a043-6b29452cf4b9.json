So, it's kind of like recruiting, but instead of people, you're recruiting for things and actions.\n\nThis verb can also be intransitive (oh my!) and mean <vocabulary>to grow violent</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to become stronger</vocabulary>. It's like all of that recruiting is happening inside of you and causing some weird things to happen to you!",
