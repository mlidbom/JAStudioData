  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: She gives you some food, and it's terribly <vocabulary>bitter</vocabulary>. You look at the lady who gave you this bitter food. You say, \"<reading>She boooo</reading>\" as in, she's no good, and she serves bitter food.",
