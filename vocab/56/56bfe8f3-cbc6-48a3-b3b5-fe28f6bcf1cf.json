  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The readings for the kanji that make this word are the kun'yomi readings, where fire's <ja>ひ</ja> changes to <ja>び</ja>. You already learned the kun'yomi reading for <ja>花</ja> when you learned the kanji, so it's only a matter of remembering to use the kun'yomi for <ja>火</ja>. If you do, you should be able to read this word.",
