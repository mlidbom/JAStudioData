You haven't learned this reading for <ja>頭</ja> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nIf you really want to get a <vocabulary>larynx</vocabulary> work out, go to <ja><reading>とう</reading>きょう</ja>. It's loud, it's crowded, and you have to yell the entire time to get people to hear what you have to say. You also know 18 levels of kanji and you really want to shout them all out, which makes your <vocabulary>voice box</vocabulary> tired (but makes you happy).",
