  "sourceMnemonic": "Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>savings</kanji>, so the verb vocab version would become <vocabulary>to save</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to put something aside</vocabulary>. Basically, you're saving up, which is good to do, I'm told.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You need <vocabulary>to save</vocabulary>, so you <reading>take one</reading> (<ja>たくわ</ja>) and put it aside, then take another and use it. This way you will have saved at least half.",
