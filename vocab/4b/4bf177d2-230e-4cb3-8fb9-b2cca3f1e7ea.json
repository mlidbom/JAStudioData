  "sourceMnemonic": "This word is a single kanji with hiragana attached, though there is no specific clue as to what type of word it is. That means you can usually guess it's a noun, adverb or na-adjective (in this case it's a noun / adverb). The meaning of this word is pretty much the same as the kanji, though, making it fairly easy. The kanji meaning for <kanji><ja>少</ja></kanji> is <kanji>few</kanji>, and the meaning of the vocab form is <vocabulary>a little</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>a few</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Did you know that this word created an English word you probably already know? Have you ever heard someone say \"just a skosh\"? That's <vocabulary><ja>少し</ja></vocabulary>! Hopefully you know this English word and therefore know this Japanese word as well.",
