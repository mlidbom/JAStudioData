It's the kun'yomi vocab reading, probably because the literal translation is \"mother parent\" and therefore consists of a couple words combined together into one concept. So, make sure you know the separate word readings of <ja>母</ja> and <ja>親</ja>. If you do, you should be able to read this too.",
