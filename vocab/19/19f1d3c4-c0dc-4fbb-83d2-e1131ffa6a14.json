  "sourceMnemonic": "This is a single kanji with an <ja>い</ja> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <kanji>black</kanji>? It's also <vocabulary>black</vocabulary>. Special Note: The noun version of black also exists in Japanese. It is just <ja>黒</ja> with the same pronunciation, but minus the <ja>い</ja> which makes it adjective-tastic.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nThink of black things. One very common black thing is the common <reading>crow</reading> (<ja>くろ</ja>). Associate those two together.",
