  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: It looks like something is going <vocabulary>to appear</vocabulary> in front of you. You are so scared and surprised you can't even speak properly: \"<reading>Are wha</reading>t??\" (<ja>あらわ</ja>) you ask, trying to figure out what's appearing in front of you.",
