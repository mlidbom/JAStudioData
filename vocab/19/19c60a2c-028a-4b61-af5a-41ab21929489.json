  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "This word uses the kun'yomi reading for the first kanji and the on'yomi readings for the second two. You haven't learned this reading for <ja>工</ja> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n\nYou want your <vocabulary>sugar sculptures</vocabulary> to be made into <reading>coo</reading>kies (<ja>く</ja>)! Cookies are your other favorite snack, so having a cookie that's really just entirely made of sugar is the absolute best.\n\nAlso, watch out for the rendaku on <ja>細</ja>, it's easy to miss if you're focusing on remembering this new on'yomi reading.",
