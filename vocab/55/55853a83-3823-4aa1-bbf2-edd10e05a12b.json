  "sourceMnemonic": "You know that the kanji <ja>付</ja> means <kanji>attach</kanji> and words like <ja>付く</ja> mean \"to be attached.\" This has the same idea. When you see this attached to another word, for example, you might know that something is attached to something else, or perhaps <vocabulary>included</vocabulary> with it. For example, if you stay at a hotel room, maybe it is a breakfast<ja>付き</ja>, i.e. \"<vocabulary>including</vocabulary> breakfast.\"",
