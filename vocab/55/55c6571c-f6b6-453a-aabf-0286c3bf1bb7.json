  "sourceMnemonic": "The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Can also mean <vocabulary>flour</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: You have this great ice cream... that is, until your <reading>cone</reading> (<ja>こな</ja>) turns to <vocabulary>powder</vocabulary>, and your ice cream falls to the ground. A sonic boom powdered your ice cream cone, and left you very messy.\n\nYou can also use <ja>こ</ja> for this kanji. Just imagine that the powder breaks down even further, and all that is left of the reading is <ja>こ</ja>. This reading feels a bit older, but it's still a-okay. ",
