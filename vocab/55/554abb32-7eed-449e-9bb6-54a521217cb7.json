  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "You never wrap things once, you always wrap them twice. And then you double that. It's a <reading>two two</reading> (<ja>つつ</ja>) wrapping technique.\n\n<ja>つつむ</ja> is the reading we want you to focus on, but it's good to know that <ja>包む</ja> can be read as <ja>くるむ</ja> as well. <ja>くるむ</ja> is used when you wrap something up carefully and protectively, like a baby in a blanket. <ja>つつむ</ja> on the other hand, has broader use and is commonly used for wrapping things like presents.",
