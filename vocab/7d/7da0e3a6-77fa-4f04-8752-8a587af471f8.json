  "sourceMnemonic": "You know that <ja>好</ja> means <kanji>like</kanji> and this vocab word means the same thing: <vocabulary>like</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>love</vocabulary>!\n\nThis word is an adjective in Japanese, so a more literal translation is <vocabulary>likable</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>lovable</vocabulary>. Still, it usually sounds more natural to translate it as a verb in English.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nWho do you <vocabulary>like</vocabulary> more than anyone? Your friend <reading>Sue</reading>. If you know someone named Sue, pretend you like her. If you don't, think of a famous person you know named Sue and use her, pretending you're good friends that like each other a lot.",
