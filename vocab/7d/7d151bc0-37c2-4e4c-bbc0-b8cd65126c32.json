  "sourceMnemonic": "Another verb for this kanji! Crazy! I know, I'm sorry. The previous ones were: <ja>着る</ja> (to wear), <ja>着く</ja> (to arrive), and now <ja>着ける</ja> (to put on / to wear). At least it's similar to <ja>着る</ja>, right? In this case, this word is like <ja>付ける</ja>, which means \"to attach.\" It's used for things you \"attach\" to your body to wear, like accessories, or a face mask. That's why this is <vocabulary>to put on</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to wear</vocabulary>. Same sound, different kanji, similar ideas.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The reading is the same as <ja>着く</ja>'s reading, but it might be easier to think it shares a reading with <ja>付ける</ja>, which has a similar meaning. Put on clothes, attach on clothes, etc!",
