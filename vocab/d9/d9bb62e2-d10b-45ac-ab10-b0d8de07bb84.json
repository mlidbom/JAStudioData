  "sourceMnemonic": "This one is a little bit off and will take a little extra remembering. The kanji means <kanji>extinction</kanji> or <kanji>die out</kanji>, but the verb version here is <vocabulary>to sever</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to cut off</vocabulary>. The ideas are pretty similar, but the wording isn't the same. Just think, when you put something to extinction, you have <vocabulary>to cut off</vocabulary> that thing from your life. Put it in extinction. You have <vocabulary>to sever</vocabulary> it.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nIn terms of things you need <vocabulary>to sever</vocabulary>, <reading>ta</reading>cos (<ja>た</ja>) are #1 on your list. No more tacos for you, going to cut those off from my diet.",
