This area of study is <vocabulary>geometry</vocabulary>, because you have to ask how many sides and how much the area is or something (can you tell I don't remember any maths?).",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "The <ja>学</ja> is read correctly, in terms of what you learned. The <ja>幾</ja> and <ja>何</ja> is weird, though. Just think how when you're asking a question in Japanese, you end the sentence with <ja>か</ja>. So, it's like, \"<ja>何か</ja>????\" and that's why it becomes <ja>か</ja>. Then, for <ja>幾</ja> think about how the <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>) to answering geometry questions correctly is figuring out \"how many\" sides something has. So, \"do you have the <reading>key</reading><ja><reading>か</reading></ja>?\"",
