  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>give up</kanji> or <kanji>abandon</kanji> so the verb version is <vocabulary>to give up</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to abandon</vocabulary>.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "You hopefully learned this reading with the kanji, but here's a reminder just in case:\n\nJust before you're ready <vocabulary>to give up</vocabulary> on something, you yell, \"<reading>AKIRA</reading> (<ja>あきら</ja>)!\". You don't know anyone named Akira, you just saw it in a movie once and it made sense, you know? So now when you've tried really hard on something, but you have to abandon it anyway, you shout AKIRA into the sky. I just did it while trying to write this mnemonic!",
