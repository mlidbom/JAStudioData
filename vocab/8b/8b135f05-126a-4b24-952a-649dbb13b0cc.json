  "sourceMnemonic": "This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>yearn for</kanji>, so the verb version is <vocabulary>to yearn for</vocabulary>. But that sounds kinda old fashioned, so you can just use <vocabulary>to adore</vocabulary> too.",
  "sourceReadingMnemonic": "Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \n\nYou realize you're starting <vocabulary>to yearn for</vocabulary> someone way more than you used to. \"<reading>Sh*t</reading> (<ja>した</ja>)... \" you say to yourself. This wasn't supposed to happen. Anytime you start to adore someone like that you always know you're getting into a bunch of sh*t you don't want to deal with. Damn these emotions!",
