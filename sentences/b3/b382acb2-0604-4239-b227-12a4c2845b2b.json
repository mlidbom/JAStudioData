It can also mean: \"I don't care\". Have a look at the ref I added. This btw. is another example for the whitespace issue: It's actually betsu + ni, but often taught as single word.<br><br>sambonjuku explains this well, but also admits that it's difficult. This channel is already on the video mining list, but this particular video is still way too difficult. I will make sure that it's added to the jlab video list though, so don't worry if you don't fully understand betsu ni for now.<br><br><em>Uh, adding the betsu and betsu ni cards (4 in total) just took me almost one hour, mining at this slow speed is sometimes not fun. At least I hope it makes learning faster for you!</em>",
