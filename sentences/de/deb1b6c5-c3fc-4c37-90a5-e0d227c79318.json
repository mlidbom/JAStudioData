  "sourceComments": "<br><br>\"eithi-n\" sounds familiar? It's the English \"eighteen\" adapted to Japanese and is probably not a real Japanese word. You find these kind of things very often in anime, maybe to sound cool.<br>However, many common Japanese words are directly adapted from English (and other languages) into Japanese. These words are always written in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana\">Katakana</a>.<br><br>\"ha\" (always spelled in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana\">Hiragana</a>: は) is the \"topic particle\" and is always pronounced \"wa\". It's attached to a noun and identifies it as the topic of what you're talking about or as topic of the sentence. It's very important to keep in mind that \"watashi ha\" is almost certainly omitted, if it's clear that it is YOU who's being talked about.<br><br>Remark: In most romanization systems, this particle is spelled \"wa\" - the way it is pronounced. However, I decided to stick to the way it is written, i.e. for all jlab materials, it is \"ha/は\".<br>",
