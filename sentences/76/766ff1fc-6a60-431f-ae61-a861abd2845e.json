Moreover, all number readings are irregular (omg), therefore some textbooks refer to this as a separate counting system.<br><br>This counter is used most often when you are describing medium sized things that don’t really have a distinct shape, like toys, ice cream, drinks or meals at a restaurant, and because of this they use it a lot in shops and when you eat out.",
