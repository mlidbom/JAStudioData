With the tsunami came a great windy storm that blew many flowers all about. It’s a pretty sight amongst all the destruction.",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine being out in this tsunami induced storm. You can feel the rain and wind on your skin – you’re wet, cold, and scared. But you see some flowers being blown to the ground and you are mesmerized by the dance they do on the wind before they finally fall to the ground.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You want to save these flowers you see <kanji>fall</kanji>ing in around you, so you take out a drying <reading>rack</reading> (<ja>らく</ja>) and place them carefully on it. Now whenever you feel scared, you can look at the flowers on this rack and you won't be scared anymore.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine running around catching the flowers as they fall. Imagine placing each little petal onto the rack to keep it safe and dry.",
