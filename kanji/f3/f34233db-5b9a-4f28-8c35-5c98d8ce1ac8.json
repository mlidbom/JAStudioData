If you just throw a stool on the ground it will flop over easily. But if you have a servant to dig it into the dirt a bit, it becomes nice and solid and safe for sitting!",
  "meaningInfo": "Picture two stools in your mind. One is solid, you want to sit on it. The other looks like the wind will knock it over. Don't sit on that!",
  "readingMnemonic": "You need this stool to be extra <kanji>solid</kanji> because you're using it to test your new <reading>cata</reading>pult (<ja>かた</ja>). If it isn't solid, when you launch it and yourself in the catapult, the stool might fall over, killing you both. And you don't want that, now do you?",
  "readingInfo": "You better hope that catapult is solid too. If it isn't the whole thing will come apart when you try to launch yourself into the air.",
