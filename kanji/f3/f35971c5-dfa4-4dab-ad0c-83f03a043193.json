You take this angel, chop him up into tiny pieces, and dry him out. Then, you make <kanji>tea</kanji> out of all the dried up angel bits. You wear the hat, though.",
  "meaningInfo": "How does this angel-flower tea taste? Be sure to imagine it. Probably heavenly *rimshot.*",
  "readingMnemonic": "In your <kanji>tea</kanji> you find a little metal button. I guess you missed it while you turned the angel into tea. You look at the button - on the back it says \"To <reading>Cha</reading>d, you'll make an awesome angel.\" Looks like you're drinking Chad the Angel.",
  "readingInfo": "It gets kind of weird when you know their names... Usually you just make them into tea without knowing who they are (easier that way). This one... this one is Chad, and you remember it vividly, because now you feel kind of bad.",
