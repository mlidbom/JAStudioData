Monks have amazing skills like that. And I'm sure you've seen monks wandering around in lots of media. They don't need maps or smartphones. They just look at the dirt and let the earth guide them to where they need to be.",

The bowling ball rolls off, the monk follows it, and then heads off in that direction.",
