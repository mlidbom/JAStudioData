It focused its rays to take out one man... and that man is Friedrich <reading>Nietzsche</reading> (<ja>にち</ja>), famous philosopher. He philosophized one too many things about the sun, so the sun decided it was time he paid.",
  "readingInfo": "This reading will be easier to remember if you know of Friedrich Nietzsche... so do your research and learn about him if you don't. He's a pretty historical dude. Imagine the sun totally pissed off, too. It makes a grunting noise as it builds up a sun beam to blast him off the face of the earth.\n\nAlso note that there's another reading worth learning as well: <ja>じつ</ja>. The reading can be remembered by thinking \"<reading>Gee! Two</reading> readings?\" Because, seriously, two readings? Too many...",
