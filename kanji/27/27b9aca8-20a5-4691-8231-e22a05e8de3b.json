Imagine kicking this lid so hard that it flies into space. See it fly up to the peak of its arch, then watch as it begins the decline until it finally collides with the sun.",
  "meaningInfo": "As you watch the lid decline, keep in mind that the sun radical has its middle line extending outside the box on both sides. This is because the sun is going supernova. Pew!",

Swing on some vines in the direction opposite of the sun. You know that once that lid finishes its decline and collides with the sun, there’s gonna be trouble.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine swinging on these vines as you hear the sun explode and go supernova behind you. Swing faster! Swing faster!",
