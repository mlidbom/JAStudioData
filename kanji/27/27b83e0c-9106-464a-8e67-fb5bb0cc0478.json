  "meaningInfo": "Imagine the alligator riding the tsunami in. When he hits the ground, and the water recedes, he's all alone in a pond, but it doesn't provide much for him. Imagine him looking for food in the little, shallow pond. Imagine him trying to stay wet... it's just not a great situation to be in, unfortunately.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The worst part about this <kanji>pond</kanji> is that the only thing for the alligator to eat is <reading>chee</reading>se (<ja>ち</ja>). Cheese may be yummy for humans, but alligators hate it. They'd rather eat the cow the cheese came from. Sadly, this pond is full of cheese.",
  "readingInfo": "Picture an alligator crying in a pond full of cheese. It's eating a piece really slowly and weeping.",
