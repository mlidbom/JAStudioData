You never really have to act all nice and humble before anyone else, but if you meet a god... well... you should probably lower yourself appropriately. They can smite you and all that.",

No, no, get your shins flat on the ground to show how humble you really are. Luckily, you're wearing <reading>jean</reading>s (<ja>じん</ja>), so at least that will stop your poor shins getting chafed!",
  "readingInfo": "If you don't get down on your shins before god, they could take them away. Even your jeans couldn't protect you then. You don't want to live a shin-less life, do you?",
