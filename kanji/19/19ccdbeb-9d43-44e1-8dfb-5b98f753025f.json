Jackhammers are loud, and your hat is doing nothing to dampen the racket. There’s a surplus of commotion coming from the jackhammer and onlookers are not amused.",
  "meaningInfo": "The hat you’re wearing is ridiculous, giving you a surplus of bad style. Imagine a bunch of people scowling at you, not only because of your crazy hat, but because of the annoying sound of the jackhammer. Hear the obnoxious noise around you as the jackhammer rattles your bones.",
