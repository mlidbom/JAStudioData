Some kind of piceratops, if you will. The reason they are this shape is because they want to absorb as much <kanji>sunlight</kanji> (or just <kanji>light</kanji> is fine, too) as possible. They evolved to be round so they don't have any corners casting a shadow.",
  "meaningInfo": "Absorbing sunlight is natural for reptiles, after all. And a round one can absorb even more light. Imagine it sitting in a round spot of sun, enjoying the warmth. What a rare sight you've come across!",
  "readingMnemonic": "As you watch this majestic beast absorbing <kanji>sunlight</kanji>, suddenly several dozen feral (<ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>)s burst from various hiding spots, spears in hand. Oh no! Those <ja>こういち</ja>s are hunting this rare piceratops!",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine many different (but also kind of the same) <ja>こういち</ja>s attacking and throwing spears at the piceratops. But, because it was able to charge up in the sunlight, it uses its powers to shoot light in all directions, rendering all the <ja>こういち</ja>s momentarily blind, allowing it to escape.",
