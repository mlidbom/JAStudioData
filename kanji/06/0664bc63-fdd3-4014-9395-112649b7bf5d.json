  "meaningInfo": "Think of as many kings as you can think of. Guess what, every single one of them (aka <kanji>all</kanji> of them) wear hats! Think of strange hats, funny hats, and normal hats. Just make sure you're amazed by the fact they all are wearing them.",
  "readingMnemonic": "But, as you're going through all the kings, it turns out not <kanji>all</kanji> of them have hats after all. The last one you come to does not have a hat. He is the king of <reading>Zen</reading> (<ja>ぜん</ja>) Buddhism. He has simple clothes and a shaved head, unlike all the other fancy kings standing around nearby.",
  "readingInfo": "To add to this story and make it more memorable, you can imagine the other kings getting upset, saying things like \"<kanji>All</kanji> kings must wear hats! You are no king!\" The king of <reading>Zen</reading> Buddhism just ignores them and begins to meditate.",
