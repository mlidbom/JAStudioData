He is so powerful, respected, and feared that people always carry his luggage for him wherever he goes. You might not think a leader of a gang called the Flowers would be intimidating, but he is.",
  "meaningInfo": "Picture this lip ring wearing gang leader. He’s clad in studded leather and has a big flower embroidered onto the back of his jacket. It’s a big thorny rose. Imagine him in your head, hear the sound of his leather outfit as he strides along unencumbered by luggage.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Remember that giant thorny rose on the lip ring wearing leader’s back? The thorns coming out of it are real, and they’re as sharp as <reading>nee</reading>dles (<ja>に</ja>). You wouldn’t want to prick your finger on them. They’re super pointy and he uses them to defend his <kanji>luggage</kanji>.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine how much it hurts to get pricked by a needle, especially on your finger. Picture this happening to you now. Not comfortable, is it?",
