  "meaningInfo": "I guess it makes sense to have a grave in a greenhouse. The heat will help the body decompose, then that nice, rich dirt will help the flowers grow.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You decide to dig even deeper into the <kanji>grave</kanji> out of curiosity and you find a <reading>bow</reading> (<ja>ぼ</ja>) and some arrows. This must be the grave of a great archer! But you probably shouldn't keep digging around in this grave looking for more stuff.",
  "readingInfo": "Hold the grave bow in your hands. It smells like dirt and wood. Maybe no one will notice if you take it... though you may end up haunted by whoever is buried in this grave.",
