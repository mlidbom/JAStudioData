Luckily the snowflakes freeze themselves into the cloth and turn into a pretty <kanji>design</kanji>. They swirl around and press a unique snowy design into the fabric. This is nice for you because you can't sew anymore with your frostbitten hands.",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine holding your creation in your frostbitten hands as the snowflake design starts to appear. The design gets more and more complicated the longer you watch, twisting this way and that, like it's dancing in front of your eyes.\n\n",
  "readingMnemonic": "As you watch the snowflake <kanji>design</kanji> form you see letters appearing in the corner! They form the name <reading>Aya</reading> (<ja>あや</ja>), our artist here at WaniKani. Somehow she's magically putting together this beautiful pattern!",
  "readingInfo": "If you know someone else called Aya, go ahead and use them in this mnemonic! Whoever it is, imagine an Aya watching from afar holding a magic wand, creating this beautiful frosty pattern!",
