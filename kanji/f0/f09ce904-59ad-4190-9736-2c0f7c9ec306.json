Crows won't hang out in your farm. Everything you grow will become large and delicious. But not everyone is so lucky that a spirit will decide to live in their scarecrow. So maybe the luck was in you all along!",

  "readingInfo": "If you get a luck spirit to say f*** you, you might accidentally convince it to move somewhere else. If it does, you lose your luck. So be careful.",
