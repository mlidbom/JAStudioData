  "readingMnemonic": "You remember <reading>Tamago</reading>tchi (<ja>たまご</ja>), right? Well, Tamagotchi is an <kanji>egg</kanji>, and the toy looks like an egg, so it’s pretty easy to remember that tamago means egg.",
  "readingInfo": "Just think Tamagotchi whenever you see this kanji. Tamagotchi = tamago = egg. Easy!",
