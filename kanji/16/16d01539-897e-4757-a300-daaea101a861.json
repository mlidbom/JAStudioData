Why does he have that there? He feels like his Shogun isn't giving him and his fellow Samurai a voice, so he's brought a flag with the word \"voice\" written on it to protest.",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine him and other samurai with their flags on sticks waving them around shouting things like \"we want a voice in politics!\" etc., etc.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Once you start asking the samurai more specific questions about how he wants more <kanji>voice</kanji> he starts playing <reading>coy</reading> (<ja>こえ</ja>) with you. He doesn't really know what he wants, he's just here for the sake of protesting.",
  "readingInfo": "Then you ask him out on a date. He still plays coy with you... one of those samurai, I guess.",
