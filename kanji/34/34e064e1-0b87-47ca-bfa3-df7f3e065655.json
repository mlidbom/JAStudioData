Sometimes if leaders aren't around all the time, people will get rebellious and act badly toward people who can get them in trouble. So when you mark them with charcoal you know that someone close with your leader is around and you should probably stop being a butt.",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine seeing one of the leader's colleagues walking around, watching you. You'd get back to work and stop goofing around, right?",
  "readingMnemonic": "You have to be good around her <kanji>colleague</kanji>s, because if you aren't your <reading>row</reading> (<ja>りょう</ja>) boat permit will be taken away. Row boating is the only fun you ever get to have, besides learning kanji. So act as best you can around the leader's colleagues so you don't lose your row boat rights.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine goofing off in your row boat and then seeing one of the colleagues waiting on the shore for you. No! She's gonna take your row boat away!",
