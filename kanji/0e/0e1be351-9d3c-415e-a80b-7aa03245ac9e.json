Flags get old, just like computers and furniture and people. So when one gets too old, you have to get on up there and install a new one in its place.",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine reaching out and grabbing onto the old flag with your fingers. Feel the dirty grime and little holes it's gotten. Now install something new!",
  "readingMnemonic": "You've decided to <kanji>install</kanji> a <reading>su</reading>it (<ja>す</ja>) where the old flag used to be. I mean, a suit is probably more durable than a flag, am I right? This way you won't have to install flags as often.",
