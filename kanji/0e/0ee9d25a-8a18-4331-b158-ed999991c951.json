  "meaningInfo": "Compare this kanji to the car kanji, <ja>車</ja>. See how the sides and top are different? Use that to remember that this car looks like it’s falling apart. See the parts dangle, and hear the drip of car fluids falling out. This car is a wreck.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You see the parts as they <kanji>dangle</kanji> off the car and you get an idea. You could probably <reading>swi</reading>ng (<ja>すい</ja>) on these dangling parts. The parts can probably take some weight still before they <kanji>drip</kanji> off the car, so you might as well swing around on them while you still can.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine yourself swinging off these dangling car parts. Hear the car creak and groan as you swing around on it, causing more fluid to drip out of the car.",
