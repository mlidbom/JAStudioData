It's the only way you can get them clean at once without the wolverines fighting over the turkey and somebody getting hurt. The tsunami is big enough to wash them all before anything bad happens.",

The tack has special sleeping medicine on it, so once they're nice and clean you can put them back in their cages without them trying to eat each other.",
  "readingInfo": "If you want to wash your animals make sure to have your special tack ready. The tsunami will recede pretty fast so get it out!",
