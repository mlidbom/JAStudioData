  "meaningInfo": "The clause states that it cannot be a tree in the summer, because that is the summer tree's territory. Same goes for autumn and spring trees. Go ahead and look at the winter tree's contract, if you want (they're nailed to every tree). There's the clause that says it can only be a tree in the winter.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This <kanji>clause</kanji> was written into all trees' contracts by <reading>Jou</reading>rm (<ja>じょう</ja>), the large farmhand. ",
  "readingInfo": "Jourm noticed that the trees were getting too crowded, so he wrote up these clauses and added them to the trees' contracts. Now, the forests are less crowded, thanks to the little clause. Makes sense that a farmhand like Jourm would do this too. The fewer trees, the more farmland. It's good for folks like Jourm.",
