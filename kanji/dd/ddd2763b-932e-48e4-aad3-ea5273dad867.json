  "meaningInfo": "Imagine tempering this gold from the east. You’re heat treating the gold when you’re tempering it, so feel the heat from the fire on your face and arms.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The smithy where you’re doing the <kanji>tempering</kanji> is pretty fancy, but it’s just a <reading>ren</reading>tal (<ja>れん</ja>). You haven’t sold enough gold to own a smithy as nice as this one yet, so for now, you rent one. It is pretty swanky though, even for a rental.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine yourself in this rental smithy. It’s really nice. There’s like TVs and live music and free WiFi and everything. It’s a very nice rental in which to do tempering. Also keep in mind that this kanji shares its reading with <ja>練</ja>, which has the same right side.",
