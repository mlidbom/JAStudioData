Wolverines aren’t meant to be kept in cages, let alone barbed prisons. There’s going to be some sort of conflict here, and animal activist groups are not going to be happy with you.",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine you’re the wolverine in this barbed prison. There’s hardly enough room for you to even turn around in here. The barbs keep poking you as well. Have you ever run into a barbed wire fence? It’s not pleasant.",
  "readingMnemonic": "When the wolverine cuts itself inside the barbed prison (which is inevitable), the conflict changes. Now there is a <kanji>conflict</kanji> between the wolverine and its <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>). Does it lose it and become a shell of its former self? Or does it keep fighting and try to hang onto what's left of its soul?",
  "readingInfo": "Pretend you're the wolverine once again. You're already in pain from gouging yourself in this barbed prison. But now you can feel a conflict within yourself. Your soul can't take this. You have to hold on, but it's so hard to keep fighting.",
