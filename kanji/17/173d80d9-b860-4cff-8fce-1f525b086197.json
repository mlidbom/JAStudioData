Horses are super afraid of spiders, you see, so if they see one, they'll bolt and reach top speed! That's actually the only way to get a horse to run that fast. ",

I say soon because it hasn't quite caught on yet. But if you help to spread the word it can happen even sooner.",
  "readingInfo": "Soon the world will be filled with horses running at full speed all thanks to the spider increase of the 2000s! Soon we will be in the future of top speeds!",
