The only downside to a building is that they're high and if you fall off of them you could die. So if someone says they're anti-building, they're really just anti-heights.",

You're right, because he doesn't like to walk all the way up high buildings, it freaks him out. He flies up instead so he doesn't have to think about falling.",
