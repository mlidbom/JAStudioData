Whether they actually use these dialects with you is another story. But when they're alone, or with other people who are from the same place, their speech will be different.",

  "readingMnemonic": "The best way to learn someone's <kanji>dialect</kanji> is to buy them a <reading>ben</reading>to (<ja>べん</ja>) from where they're from. Not only do these bento have writing in their dialect on them, but their speech will immediately shift to match. Then you'll be able to hear how they sound in their head and in private!",
