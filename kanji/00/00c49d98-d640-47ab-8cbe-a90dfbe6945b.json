Without a heart, you’d have no blood pumping and you would start to die. This would make it increasingly harder to draw breath and get oxygen to stay alive.",

  "readingMnemonic": "You know how when people are unconscious and their <kanji>breath</kanji> slows or comes to a stop, they use smelling salts to revive them? Well a smelly <reading>sock</reading> (<ja>そく</ja>) can work just as well. Socks get really stinky and their stench is powerful enough to revive someone who isn’t drawing breath.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine smelling this smelly sock. Imagine the smelly stench of the dirty sock wafting up into your nostrils and filling your lungs with its odor. Gross.",
