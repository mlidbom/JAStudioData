Sometimes this will happen (where we have to use a slightly \"modified radical\" version of the original), so it's good to understand that now, early on. In this case, we have fins. How many fins? <kanji>Eight</kanji> fins. How do you know that? Because you caught four fish with two fins each.",
  "meaningInfo": "Count the fins out in front of you, all the way from one to eight. It'll help if you actually do this. Now smell each fin, and think \"Wow, I have to smell all eight of these?\" Yes, you do.",
  "readingMnemonic": "After you count and smell all <kanji>eight</kanji> of your fins, it's time to put them away. You open a large <reading>hatch</reading> (<ja>はち</ja>) and put them in. This is where you keep your fins, always putting in eight at a time because that's what the boss wants.",
  "readingInfo": "You've asked him why you can only put eight fins at a time in the hatch, but he never wants to answer. What could be down in the hole that the hatch covers? Why is there a hatch at all? What's with numbers and hatches being mysterious?",
