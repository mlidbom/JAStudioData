  "meaningInfo": "Note that the sheep has to sweep its tail to one side so that it doesn't get in the way of all the construction tools. That's why it looks a little different here. Imagine a sheep in a hard hat, with its tail on one side, getting down to some construction. How very distinctive.",

  "readingInfo": "Imagine the sheep holding the saw in its hooves. It isn't easy to grip a saw with hooves, but this is no ordinary sheep.",
