You try to grab the insect but it keeps sliding past your hand because the wind is so strong. It’s going to start blowing you around under the table too!",
  "meaningInfo": "Picture an insect, on its back, being blown around under a table. Feel the wind pushing you as you try to save the poor thing.\n\nThis kanji also means <kanji>style</kanji> too. You can think of the wind blowing one style in fashion one moment and then another the next. It blows your clothes off and blows new style clothes onto you, over and over again. Imagine this happening. Are you embarrassed when all the clothes are off? Pleased when you get new style clothes on?",
  "readingMnemonic": "The only way you can distract yourself from the <kanji>wind</kanji> and the insect sliding around under your table is by eating lots of <reading>foo</reading>d (<ja>ふう</ja>). That’s why you were at the table in the first place. It’s your dining room table and it’s dinner time!",
  "readingInfo": "Try to stuff food in your mouth in the wind. Food tastes even better when you have to fight for it!\n",
