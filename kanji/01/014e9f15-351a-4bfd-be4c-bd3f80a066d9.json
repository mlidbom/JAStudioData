  "sourceMeaningMnemonic": "There's a <radical>mouth</radical> inside a <radical>mouth</radical>. But if you look even closer (not actually, but we're pretending), you can see another mouth inside that mouth... and another one inside of that one! It keeps going and going. Can you count the number of <kanji>times</kanji> there's a mouth inside a mouth? This kanji also means <kanji>revolve</kanji> too. Think of each \"time\" a thing happens, it loops back around and comes back to the beginning, revolving around again another time.",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine yourself counting and counting smaller and smaller mouths inside of each other, recording the number of times you can find a mouth inside another mouth. Dig deeper and deeper until it feels ridiculous how small the mouths are getting. Be sure to focus on the counting and the number of times you find one. Now, how many mouths is this times two, because your mouth is like this too.",
  "readingMnemonic": "If you're having a hard time wrapping your head around the infinite number of <kanji>times</kanji> these mouths <kanji>revolve</kanji>, just picture yourself in a little <reading>kay</reading>ak (<ja>かい</ja>) going around and down through the mouths.",
  "readingInfo": "Your kayak is slashing and dipping through the revolving mouths, going down and down more times than you can count!",
