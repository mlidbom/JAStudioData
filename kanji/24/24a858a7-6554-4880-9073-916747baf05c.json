  "meaningInfo": "Imagine this terrifying samurai. You have legs… okay, that’s normal. But, then you have just a giant forehead on the top of everything else, walking around. It's pretty scary that someone would sell such important parts of their body.",
  "readingMnemonic": "If you see a samurai trying to <kanji>sell</kanji> all their body parts here's what you should say, \"<reading>Bye</reading> (<ja>ばい</ja>)!\" and just get the heck out of there. Actually, if anyone tries to sell you a body part you should probably say bye over and over until you can get away from them.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine saying, \"Bye,\" loudly into the forehead of a samurai trying to sell you the rest of their face. If you say it loud enough it will distract them while you run away.",
