The cloud floats above him and when he wants to tell people something he just whispers into the cloud and it transmits his message really, really loudly to all of them.",
  "meaningInfo": "Picture this special cloud floating above your leader. It's probably just a speaker attached to a drone covered in cotton balls.",
  "readingMnemonic": "As the leader <kanji>transmit</kanji>s his latest series of messages to you and the others, you notice a pretty large <reading>den</reading>t (<ja>でん</ja>) in it. That dent is probably a clue to what this cloud is really made of.",
  "readingInfo": "You highly doubt this is a magical cloud that can transmit messages. You inch closer to the big dent and try to poke it. Your finger goes right in! Hmm, you're still pretty sure there's a trick to this thing.",
