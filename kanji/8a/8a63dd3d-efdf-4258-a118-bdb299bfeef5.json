May seem like a distraction, but if you come back knowing the reading for this kanji, then it's totally worth while.\n\nWhen you think about a circle, think about <reading>Maru</reading> all rolled up in a little circle, being super adorable. Don't tell me it doesn't melt your heart just thinking about it.\n\nAlternatively, you could also look at this kanji and think of Maru inside of a box, with his little tail sticking out of it. Whatever works best for you, just get yourself to \"Maru.\"",
  "readingInfo": "Obviously if you \"don't know this reading\" well enough, you should watch some more Maru videos. I'll understand... just make sure you come back someday, okay?",
