  "readingMnemonic": "Unfortunately, the <kanji>author</kanji> is allergic to flowers. They are only allergic to touching them though, so the author is holding the flowers with a pair of <reading>cho</reading>psticks (<ja>ちょ</ja>), really close to their face. Using the chopsticks, they can still use the flowers to think of fancy, author-ly words without touching them.",
  "readingInfo": "Picture the author trying to use chopsticks to move around a little flower. It looks like they're having a hard time, but people will do anything to be a great author, I suppose.",
