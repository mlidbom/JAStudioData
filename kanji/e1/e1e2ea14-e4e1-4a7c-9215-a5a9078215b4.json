  "readingMnemonic": "While you're fake <kanji>Noh chanting</kanji> you have to pause every few minutes to take a bite of <reading>yo</reading>gurt (<ja>よう</ja>). Yogurt is good for the throat! At least you think it is. It's not like you're actually chanting, the satellite is doing all the real work.",
  "readingInfo": "Watch closely the next time you go to a Noh play. See the man Noh chanting? Watch close enough and you'll see him eat a scoop of yogurt every once in a while.",
