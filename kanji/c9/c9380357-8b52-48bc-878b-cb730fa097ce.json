He doesn’t really take sides in matters, and just stays in the middle. This makes him seem like sort of a wishy washy people pleaser, and as such his relationships with people are rarely anything more than average.",
  "meaningInfo": "I’m sure you’ve heard of “flip-floppers” in politics, or people who try and take both sides of an issue, always staying in the middle ground and never really taking a stand. Imagine one of these people to represent this kanji.",
  "readingMnemonic": "This kanji is pronounced exactly like the kanji <ja>中</ja> (<ja>なか</ja>). It's one of those kanji where you can figure out the reading from one of the radicals.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine your favorite flip-flopper from before. Now imagine that there’s a knocker on his forehead and you get to knock that knocker as hard as you like. Sounds like fun, doesn’t it? Imagine yourself doing this.",
