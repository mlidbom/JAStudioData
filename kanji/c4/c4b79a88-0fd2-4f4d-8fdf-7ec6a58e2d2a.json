It's not any normal hill, it's a weird lumpy hill that isn't quite right. That's because it is a thread hill of <kanji>netting</kanji>, and parts of the nets have caught things, like fish and cats, so there's weird abnormal lumps in them.",
  "meaningInfo": "You'll need to differentiate this from <ja>綱</ja>, which uses the same radicals (though <ja>綱</ja> has a real hill radical). Just remember that the weird \"hill\" has stuff caught in it because it is <kanji>netting</kanji>.",
