To remember it, think about a tree with lots of branches. The branches support each other and the trunk of the tree. If you were to climb the tree, the branches would be able to support your weight too!",

A very, very big sheep. Uh oh... no no, sheep. If you get on this branch it won't be able to support all this weight!!!",
  "readingInfo": "The big sheep walks up the side of the tree with its weird hooves and starts to put its weight on the branch. \"No no no!\" you and your whole family scream. The branch can't support the weight of the sheep. It snaps! You all tumble to the ground.\n\nThe end.",
