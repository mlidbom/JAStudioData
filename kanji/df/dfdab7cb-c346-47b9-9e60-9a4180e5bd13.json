  "meaningInfo": "The scarecrow creeps you out. You don't want to look at it anymore, so you're standing eerily close to it measuring its width, so you can hide it forever.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You finish measuring the <kanji>width</kanji> of the scarecrow and the width of the towel, and you realize you're the width of a <reading>haba</reading>nero (<ja>はば</ja>) pepper short. This is fine, you grow those. This is a whole field of habaneros! So you pluck one off the nearest plant, tape it to the cloth, and cover that scarecrow right up.",
  "readingInfo": "Do you know the width of a habanero? It's one scarecrow minus one cloth.",
