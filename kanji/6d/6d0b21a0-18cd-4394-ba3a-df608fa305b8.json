The sheep have been genetically combined with fish, so the sheep have fins (and they've lost their tails - which is why the tail part of the sheep radical is missing in this kanji!). These sheep fins are very rich in nutrients and as such are very good for foster children that need to grow up big and strong.",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine eating a fish fin with sheep wool on it. It tastes fishy like the ocean but the wool tastes like clothes. It’s probably the worst thing ever. Imagine eating something like this and taste its flavor on your tongue.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The best way to <kanji>foster</kanji> a better relationship with these foster kids would be to give them some <reading>yo</reading>gurt (<ja>よう</ja>). Maybe they can dip the sheep fins in the yogurt to help mask the strange taste. Yogurt is also very nutritious, so it’s a good supplement to the foster kids’ diet.",
  "readingInfo": "Remember how bad those sheep fins tasted? Now imagine eating your favorite yogurt flavor instead. This yogurt is delicious.",
