The water from the tsunami made all the sidewalks and stairs too slippery to walk on, but you tried anyway, slipped, and broke a couple bones.",

  "readingInfo": "Picture the cats trying to walk on the slippery ground. Their legs keep spreading, so they try to jump, but that makes the slipping worse, and they go sliding forward and topple over their fluffy buns and onto your broken body. Now the cats are all perching on top of you and your broken bones as they try to avoid the slippery ground. It would be nice if they didn't have their claws out.",
