  "meaningInfo": "Picture this tsunami wave hitting the tree. It’s like a lumberjack axe of water, cutting deep into the tree with the force of a thousand lumberjacks.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Some tsunamis cut so <kanji>deep</kanji> that they flat out chop the tree right off its stump. In areas like this, you have to be careful not to bang a <reading>shin</reading> (<ja>しん</ja>) on them. These stumps are right about shin height, so you want to be cautious when walking around them as to not injure yourself.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine being deep in the woods and banging your shin on a stump you didn’t see. It hurts to bang your shin, so imagine this pain and the awful sensation it brings.",
