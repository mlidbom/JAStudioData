  "meaningInfo": "Marriage is a big deal and it's going to connect your two clans, so you have to do the ceremony in the sun in front of everyone so they can see.",
  "readingMnemonic": "For the <kanji>marriage</kanji> to be official, you need to wait for a <reading>con</reading>dor (<ja>こん</ja>) to appear. If it doesn't show up before the sun goes down again, the marriage was a failure. You have to try again tomorrow with a different woman.",
  "readingInfo": "Do you want to go through with this marriage? You better hope you see a condor then! It's the official bird of love and unification, ya know. That's why so many people wait until they're older to get married these days, because there aren't as many condors thanks to deforestation.",
