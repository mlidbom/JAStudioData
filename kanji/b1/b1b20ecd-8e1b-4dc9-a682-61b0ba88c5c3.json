Every day after school you walk straight until you get to the sock circle, you run around it, and then head off in any direction. Somehow it always leads to cram school.",

  "readingInfo": "Normal kids would probably try to juke cram school, since it's hard and it's more school than they think they need. But you're a good kid who want to cram, so you juke the circle instead.",
