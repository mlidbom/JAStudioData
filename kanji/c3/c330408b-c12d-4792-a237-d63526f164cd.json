Geoducks usually live in the ocean, not in a river, so they must study the order of water flow in order to determine the best sequence for making it into a river.",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine this geoduck mapping out a plan to get to the river. It’s studying the sequence and order of water flow. See it sitting there, reading a book, reading glasses and all. It’s quite odd.",
  "readingMnemonic": "After extensive study of the <kanji>sequence</kanji> and <kanji>order</kanji> of water, the geoduck has determined that <reading>June</reading> (<ja>じゅん</ja>) is the best time to travel to the river. June is the best time for the temperature and atmospheric pressure to be just right for such a journey. In June, the geoduck will set out.",
  "readingInfo": "June has arrived. Imagine the geoduck making its way from the ocean to the river. Use whatever makes you think of June to link that month to this scene of the geoduck making his way to the river.",
