You’ve marked it with a yellow X so the hired help knows which tree to cut down. There are a lot of trees on the side of the house, but the tree marked with a yellow X is the only one in danger of causing damage to your roof in the event of a storm.",
  "meaningInfo": "Picture the scene of a woman with a chainsaw cutting down this tree marked with a yellow X. Hear the sound of the chainsaw buzzing and the grinding of wood as it meets the side of the trunk. It’s very loud. Woodchips go flying everywhere.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Wait, that woman with the chainsaw is <reading>Yoko</reading> (<ja>よこ</ja>) Ono! Yes, the same Yoko Ono who’s married to John Lennon of the Beatles. What’s she doing chopping down trees on the <kanji>side</kanji> of your house? Who can say. Silly Yoko.",
  "readingInfo": "Now picture the same scene as before only imagining Yoko Ono wielding that chainsaw. Maybe she’s dancing. Maybe there’s some Beatles music playing in the background. Either way it’s a strange sight – remember it.",
