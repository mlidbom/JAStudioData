This is the best way to pierce a member of the shellfish family, I promise.\n\nThis kanji also has a second meaning. That shellfish you pierced with the window is in two halves now. You can use those halves as plates for sushi. If you count the broken shells you'll know how much sushi you have. That makes them <kanji>sushi counter</kanji>s!",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine the window piercing into the shellfish's shell. Then imagine lining up the pieces, putting sushi on them, and counting them all.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Now that your shellfish is properly <kanji>pierce</kanji>d and turned into <kanji>sushi counter</kanji>s, you can serve them to Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>) and his men. I really hope you counted them correctly too, because there are a lot of them.",
  "readingInfo": "Carefully count out all the sushi on their pierced shell plates and place them in front of Genghis Khan and his army. As you reach Genghis Khan himself, you realize it's just his ghost, but he's still staring at you as you serve his troops. Ghost or not, you don't want him to pierce you if you mess up. ",
