White snow is normal, red would just be strange. Can you imagine what it would be like if the winter snow changed to the color of red?",

  "readingInfo": "Imagine if hens were purple, or even other strange colors. It would be an unexpected change. Imagine this army of rainbow colored hens strutting around and clucking up a storm.",
