You rub your eyes and when you open them again there is a <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>) in a <reading>su</reading>it (<ja>す</ja>) in front of you. You yelp, blink, and it's back to being a child. Are... all children really just sheep in suits?!",
  "readingInfo": "The child runs away and you chase after it. Every time it's about to turn a corner it looks like a sheep in a suit again, but whenever you yell and point, it turns back. You're the only one who can see this sheep suit child!!",
