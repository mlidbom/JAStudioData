  "sourceMeaningMnemonic": "A <radical>tsunami</radical> is the <radical>same</radical> as a <kanji>cave</kanji>. Because, if a wave is big enough, it will curl over on itself, creating a sort of cave within the wave. That's why it's the same as a cave!",
  "meaningInfo": "Also, imagine a tsunami hitting a cave, becoming the same as the cave (since a cave will shape it).",
  "readingMnemonic": "Best way to remember the reading for this kanji is to think about how the shape of a cave is the shape of a <reading>dou</reading>ghnut (<ja>どう</ja>).",
  "readingInfo": "Also note that the <ja>同</ja> part of this kanji gives away the reading as well. <ja>同</ja> and <ja>洞</ja> have the same readings!",
