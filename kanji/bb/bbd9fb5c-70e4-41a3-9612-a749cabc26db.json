  "meaningInfo": "Also, imagine a tsunami hitting a cave, becoming the same as the cave (since a cave will shape it).",
  "readingMnemonic": "Best way to remember the reading for this kanji is to think about how the shape of a cave is the shape of a <reading>dou</reading>ghnut (<ja>どう</ja>).",
  "readingInfo": "Also note that the <ja>同</ja> part of this kanji gives away the reading as well. <ja>同</ja> and <ja>洞</ja> have the same readings!",
