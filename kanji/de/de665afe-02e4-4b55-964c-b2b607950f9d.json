  "readingMnemonic": "Actually, you're unearthing <reading>Je</reading>sus (<ja>じ</ja>). He’s the treasure. For your soul. He’s here to show you that Jesus is still a hip and cool guy and he wants to <kanji>indicate</kanji> to you that having faith in Jesus and God and stuff is super rad. Jesus is all like, “Who has two thumbs and wants to <kanji>show</kanji> you the way of the Lord? This guy.”",
  "readingInfo": "Picture Jesus getting all over the top and super preachy about his religious beliefs. He’s doing everything he can to indicate to the crowd that he’s the best, and show them how cool he is. Listen to Jesus preach to the crowd, desperate for their attention.",
