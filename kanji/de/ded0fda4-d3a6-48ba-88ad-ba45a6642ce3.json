That should help you remember that this means <kanji>right</kanji>.",

  "readingMnemonic": "How did we know to look from the <kanji>right</kanji>, though? Because the <reading>you</reading>ths (<ja>ゆう</ja>) figured it out. Youths think in ways that older people usually don't. That's why they can see the swirls on cereal, hear the music behind noise, and of course, look at things from the right side.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine a bunch of youths walking in a group and looking at everything from the right. You remember when you were a youth and you used to look at everything from one side too.\n\nNote: All the <ja>ゆう</ja> readings will use the word \"youths\" for the reading mnemonic. You can think of these \"youths\" as a group of younger people who cause a lot of the problems in this world.",
