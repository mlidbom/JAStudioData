  "readingInfo": "You thought Jourm was an ordinary, clumsy, ten foot tall farmhand. But he brought down a tsunami upon your village. And, he brought armed conflict too. This thing he calls \"The cleanse\" was actually something he had been planning for years. His use of a totally ordinary Viking mouth towel... his table made of foreheads... That tatami mat altar with the forehead wearing a top hat... Was he really a Viking pretending to be a simple farmhand just so he could bring his men inland to cleanse and purify your village? It's too late now. Jourm stands over your body. You are about to receive \"The cleanse\" too.",
