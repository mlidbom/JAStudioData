When you're driving or taking a train through the countryside it may seem like all of those rice paddies blurring together are all the same, but they can differ quite a bit!",
  "meaningInfo": "Try to picture how each rice paddy differs from the next. Can you think of any differences in the ones you've seen?",
  "readingMnemonic": "To see how rice paddies <kanji>differ</kanji>, you need an <reading>ea</reading>gle's (<ja>い</ja>) eye view. It can be hard to see from the ground, so soar up into the sky like an eagle and look down at the rice paddies together.",
  "readingInfo": "Aha! As an eagle you can easily see that all of the rice paddies have differing colors, shapes, and (if you fly low) smells. They differ a lot!",
