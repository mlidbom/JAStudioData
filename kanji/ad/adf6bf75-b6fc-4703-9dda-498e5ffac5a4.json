Digging with nothing but a spoon takes a long time, especially when the hole needs to be big enough for a coffin. You might as well be digging it for yourself at this rate. By the time you finish, you’ll be all wrinkled and elderly and just about ready to keel over.",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine yourself digging a coffin hole with nothing but a spoon. Your hands get all cramped, your wrist starts to hurt, and you get painful blisters on your hands. It takes forever to dig a hole big enough for a coffin!",

  "readingInfo": "You hated roe when you were still young, but now that you’re an elderly old fart you really want to eat it. Roe is for old people, you guess, as you slurp it up.",
