Put any liquid substance near fire and it will dry up actually, but syrup especially. It goes from being sticky and gooey and yummy to a pile of hard, dry sugar. Not so yummy.",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine putting some syrup over a fire and watching it dry up. Watch as the sides slowly bubble and harden and lose what makes syrup so good in the first place.",
  "readingMnemonic": "If you <kanji>dry up</kanji> syrup like this, you're removing its <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>). Have you ever seen dry syrup before? No soul in that. In fact, you probably have no soul if you can dry out syrup like this without feeling bad about it.",
  "readingInfo": "Go back to imagining a fire drying up some syrup and watch as a tiny little syrup soul cries and is released into the air. Oh no!",
