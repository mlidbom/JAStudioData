Bread bun, hot crossed buns, whatever as long as they're buns, they're great writing fuel.\n\nWhen buns aren't enough, you call in the <reading>mon</reading>ster (<ja>もん</ja>) that lives under your bed. It pretends to chase you, motivating your writing even further, because if you don't write fast, you'll die by monster bites.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine shoveling buns into your mouth and running from a monster as you're writing. You're so determined! This is going to be the best thing you've ever written!",
