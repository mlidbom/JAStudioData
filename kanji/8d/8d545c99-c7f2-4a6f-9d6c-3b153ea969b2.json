It doesn't do anything except for every day right at <kanji>noon</kanji>, when it tells you the time. \"Hey guyz, it's <kanji>noon</kanji>, mmk?\"",
  "meaningInfo": "Really try to imagine this giant shrimp on the sun as a normal thing that happens, without fail, every day. The shrimp also tells the time right at noon, every day (so important you stress remembering that it's noon, not some other time). Maybe you could have him sing a \"noon song\" in your imagination as well.",
  "readingMnemonic": "At <kanji>noon</kanji>, the shrimp also puts on its high <reading>heel</reading>s (<ja>ひる</ja>) to get ready for the evening, where it wants to make sure it looks good for the other shrimp he/she meets later on.",
  "readingInfo": "Right after the shrimp's announcement, imagine it struggling to put on heels, while sitting on the sun. This shrimp is almost bigger than the sun, actually, so all its struggles with its heels are easy to see.",
