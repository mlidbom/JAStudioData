  "readingInfo": "You'll want to remember this character, because he will come up many times throughout your WaniKani journey. Ken the samurai used to work for WaniKani, but then he went rogue because he thought WaniKani wasn't being radical enough. So now he wanders the website carrying his squid friend (who you'll meet later) in a bucket.\n\nTo help you visualize him, imagine a samurai with armor made from crab shells, a helmet that is just an alligator head, and swords with crab claw hand guards. His great beard and mustache are styled in the shape of whatever kanji is giving you the most trouble at the time.",
