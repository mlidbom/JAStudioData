Just think about the things you eat? What are they? In the simplest form, they are just meals. So, if you know \"eat\" you should be able to remember \"meal\" as well.",

  "readingInfo": "So, do you keep eating and keep getting shocked? Or do you not eat and continue to starve? What is worse? Obviously you're in one of the Saw movies, or something, too, so feel the fear. What will you choose? Life with shocks or death from hunger?",
