The coloring of your hair changes to whatever color is around you, so you use your cleats to climb trees to make your hair turn green and brown, and in the fall, yellow and orange and red!",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine digging your cleats into the bark of the tree until you get high enough for your hair to start coloring itself tree colors. It might be a lot of work, but it's worth it.",

  "readingInfo": "You couldn't take the pain of losing your cyborg, so you've become one. Your robo-hair can change its coloring, but soon you'll be even more cyborg-y than before!",
