  "sourceMeaningMnemonic": "Looking up to the <radical>cliff</radical>, you see the <radical>tree</radical>s, and the <radical>sun</radical> shining down on them. Using the sun and the trees (up there on the cliff), you've devised a method to tell what time of the year it is, based on where the shadow from the trees fall. After a while, you develop a bigger system. This system is a whole <kanji>calendar</kanji>.",
  "meaningInfo": "Look at the different shadow patterns. Know what they all mean. This is your very own calendar system.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Remember the word <ja>歴史</ja>, which means \"history\"? Using a <kanji>calendar</kanji>, you too can remember history (otherwise, who knows when these things happened). So, the reading for this kanji is the same as the reading for <ja>歴史</ja>'s beginning, because they're related.",
  "readingInfo": "Make sure you make the connection between the word <ja>歴史</ja> and this kanji. If you do, it'll be much easier to remember the reading of this kanji.",
