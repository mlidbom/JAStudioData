  "readingInfo": "Imagine running around this hot cay as you try to put out the fire in your field. The fire is ravaging the entire hot cay, so it takes you a while to put it out. Man those flames are hot.\n\nAlso, this kanji can have the reading <ja>はた</ja> for the kun'yomi as well. If you learn the longer version (<ja>はたけ</ja>) it will be easier to just shave off a kana to remember the shorter version.",
