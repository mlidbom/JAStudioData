The radical that makes up this kanji is <radical>seven</radical> and the kanji (which is exactly the same) is also <kanji>seven</kanji>. So, if you know the radical, you know the meaning of the kanji as well.",

  "readingMnemonic": "You know this kanji means <kanji>Seven</kanji>, so let's use that to remember the reading too. <kanji>Seven</kanji> is a lucky number, usually, but this time it wasn't so good. \n\n<kanji>Seven</kanji> percent is all she got on her test after <reading>she chea</reading>ted (<ja>しち</ja>) on it.",
  "readingInfo": "How unbelievable is it that someone got <kanji>seven</kanji> percent on a test, especially if you try to cheat? Imagine the girl you loathe the most from school, and imagine her cheating on the test (it's important it's a girl, because of the \"she\" part in <reading>she chea</reading>ted (<ja>しち</ja>). Then, imagine your happiness when she's super upset about getting seven percent on it. Serves her right, obviously.",
