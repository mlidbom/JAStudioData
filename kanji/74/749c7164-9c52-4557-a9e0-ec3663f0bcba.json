Wolverine had been screaming and yelling and stomping around, but when the grains entered his cleat he realized where he was. He was finally able to calm down.",
  "meaningInfo": "He's calm now because he stomped right into a farmer's field (thus the rice) and if he didn't calm down he'd probably ruin it.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Now that Wolverine is <kanji>calm</kanji>, tears come to his eyes. Being calm has given him perspective on what his anger has done. Oh, wait no. There are just some <reading>on</reading>ions (<ja>おん</ja>) in his cleats too, and they're making calm tears trickle down his eyes.",
  "readingInfo": "Picture Wolverine sitting calmly in this field, onions causing tears to stream down his cheeks as he reflects on what he's done.",
