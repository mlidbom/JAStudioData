  "readingMnemonic": "The only problem with consolidating your <kanji>merit</kanji>s like this is that rac<reading>coon</reading>s (<ja>くん</ja>) are always trying to steal them. Raccoons really like shiny, small things. Like, say, the physical representation of all your personal and professional merits.",
  "readingInfo": "This is why you never see a military officer or a girl scout leaving their merit badges out in the open. They pin them right onto their clothes. Otherwise the raccoons would come.",
