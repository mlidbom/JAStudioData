  "readingMnemonic": "As you’re peering over this tall <kanji>cliff</kanji>, somebody behind you shouts, “Hey, <reading>guy</reading> (<ja>がい</ja>)!” This startles you and you tumble down the cliff. Apparently so did he, because you can hear him saying, \"Hey guy! OOF! Are you okay? OOF! Guy? Guy!!!” as you both fall.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine falling down this huge cliff and the last words you have to hear before you splat on the ground is someone yelling \"Guy\" at you over and over. What a way to go.",
