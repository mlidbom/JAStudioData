Everyone's so busy eating and working and being at school, that they miss this awesome deal, but not you. Everyday at noon you stock up on wholesale stamps. Do you send a lot of mail? No, you probably just collect them. But they were cheap, so who cares!",

The password is \"<reading>Oh Roshi</reading>\" (<ja>おろし</ja>). Okay, so maybe that's just the name of the guy there, but it always works when I want to get stamps wholesale so you should do it too!",
  "readingInfo": "\"Oh Roshi\" you say carefully as you hand your stamps over at noon. The guy raises an eyebrow at you, but gives you them wholesale! It worked! ",
