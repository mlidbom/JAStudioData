A lot. The problem you’re now in is one of getting to a hospital and having your mouth sewn back on. The <kanji>question</kanji> is, how are you going to get to the hospital?",

  "readingMnemonic": "The reason you ran mouth first into this gate was because you were being chased by a <reading>mon</reading>ster (<ja>もん</ja>). A monster in and of itself is a big enough <kanji>problem</kanji> as is, let alone smashing your mouth into a gate. You poor, hapless soul.",
  "readingInfo": "Monsters are scary. Maybe you’ve had a dream where you were being chased by one. Remember how scary that is when you see this kanji.",
