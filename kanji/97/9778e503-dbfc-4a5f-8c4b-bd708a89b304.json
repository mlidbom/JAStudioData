  "readingMnemonic": "This <kanji>prosperity</kanji> isn't good for everyone though. You look over and see Ryu (<ja>りゅう</ja>) from Street Fighter sitting in the corner. He's got everything he could ask for. He's won the tournament, he's got money, he's got this nice big building, but now he's depressed.",
  "readingInfo": "Ryu's prosperity has made him realize that having things isn't always enough. Now he's looking wistfully outside at the winter weather, missing the rough times.",
