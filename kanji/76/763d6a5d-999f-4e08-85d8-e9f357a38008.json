The tsunami knocked this plate out of the kitchen, and now it’s just sitting outside in the sun. The sun heats things, so the plate is getting really warm.",

  "readingMnemonic": "The plate starts to get so <kanji>warm</kanji> that you could fry an <reading>on</reading>ion (<ja>おん</ja>) on it. Who doesn’t love fried onions? That plate sure is warm enough, so start cookin’ ‘em!",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine yourself frying onions on this plate warmed by the sun. Smell the onion smell as the onion fumes get into your eyes and your sinuses. It makes your eyes water as you are very sensitive to onions.",
