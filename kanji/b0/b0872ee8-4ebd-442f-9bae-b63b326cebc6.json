You look up to see who did it. There stands <reading>Chew</reading>bacca, doing his Chewbacca yell. And it isn't a stick in your mouth, it's an arrow from his crossbow (a bowcaster, actually). It just so happens Chewbacca's bowcaster looks just like this kanji too. Go figure.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine the fear and shock you'd feel after finding out it was Chewbacca who shot the middle of your mouth (and head). Touch his fur. Look really close at his weapon. Give him a sniff, too. Just so that memory never fades away.",
