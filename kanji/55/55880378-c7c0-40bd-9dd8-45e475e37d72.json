The radical is <radical>sword</radical>, but we're learning Japanese, so can you name a Japanese <kanji>sword</kanji>? That's right, the most common is a <kanji>katana</kanji>, which happens to be the meaning of this kanji as well.",
  "meaningInfo": "This kanji also looks a lot like the kanji <ja>力</ja>. To avoid getting them confused, remember that this one is missing the little nubbin at the top, because 90% of the power comes from the sword to cut your enemies down (which is why the sword kanji is 90% of the power kanji).",

To become a master katana wielder, you decide to travel to <ja><reading>とう</reading>きょう</ja> (That's Tokyo!). <ja>とうきょう</ja> has the best sword and katana schools in the world, so it makes sense to travel to <ja>とうきょう</ja>.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine trying to travel to <ja>とうきょう</ja> with your katana. Airport security is not happy with you trying to take a katana on the plane, so you get a full cavity search. I hope you don't have any other swords hidden anywhere.",
