Someone messed with the stamp machine and your friend is trying to correct the error. You’re loitering around with a gun since you’re his bodyguard. To have an error on the stamp would not be honorable, so that’s why your friend is going to correct it.",
  "meaningInfo": "Feel the weight of the gun in your hands as your friend works to make the stamp honorable again. Listen to your friend complain about how there are so few people left in the world that are honorable. Also keep in mind that the correct radical is a little different with the vertical line going through the top, so just think of that as the error trying to be corrected.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Just as you’re pondering what it means to be <kanji>honorable</kanji>, your friend gets shot by <reading>Go</reading>dzilla (<ja>ご</ja>). Godzilla must have been the one who ruined the stamp! \"Go, go, save yourself, Godzilla got me!\" your friend cries.",
  "readingInfo": "You run, leaving your friend and Godzilla to their honorable battle. A single tear runs down your cheek.",
