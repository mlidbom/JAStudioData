  "meaningInfo": "Think of how disappointed you are. You wanted a beautiful cross of flowers, and now you just have a big overgrown patch of thick grass. It isn't even pretty green grass, it's a little brown and damaged from the sun.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The <kanji>grass</kanji> on top is brown and burned from the sun, so you need to take a <reading>cool saw</reading> (<ja>くさ</ja>) and hack the tops off. The saw is actually physically cool to the touch, to help heal the grass' sunburned bits. It just happens to look cool too.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine using your cool saw to saw off the heads of all of this grass. You made the cross pretty big, so there is a ton of grass to get through. The sun is beating down on you and the grass too, which isn't making it any easier.",
