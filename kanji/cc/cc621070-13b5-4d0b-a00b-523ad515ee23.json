He's one of the people who started this website, so we'll do our best in the mnemonics to embarrass him as much as possible. Anyways, remember that whenever you see <ja>こう</ja>, think <ja>こういち</ja>.\n\nEveryone agrees, (<reading><ja>こう</ja></reading><ja>いち</ja>)'s <kanji>mouth</kanji> is his best feature. You stare at it lovingly as he whispers sweet kanji readings to you.\n\n",
  "readingInfo": "You just can't forget all the cool things about kanji learning he said from that mouth. What a great mouth <ja>こういち</ja> has. How are the lips of his mouth both so skinny and fat at the same time?",
