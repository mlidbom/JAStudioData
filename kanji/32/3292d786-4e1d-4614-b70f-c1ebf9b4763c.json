  "sourceMeaningMnemonic": "You take a <radical>rake</radical> in for a <radical>measurement</radical> but it is <kanji>resistant</kanji>. The rake doesn’t want to have its measurements taken. The rake is resistant to have any measurement taken because it feels inferior to the other rakes and doesn’t want to be embarrassed if it ends up being smaller than the others.",
  "meaningInfo": "Try and move this rake over to the measurement table. It is resistant so you have a hard time moving it. Imagine the rake struggling and resisting endlessly.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Because the rake is persistently <kanji>resistant</kanji>, you eventually tie it to the table with your neck <reading>tie</reading> (<ja>たい</ja>). The tie won’t hold for long, so you need to take each measurement quickly.",
  "readingInfo": "See yourself tying the tie around the rake and attaching it to the measurement table. The rake is still jostling around, but the tie keeps it from moving about too terribly much.",
