Libraries are quiet and generally pretty empty nowadays, so it's the perfect place to relax and do some knitting. Of course, if you find thread lying around in a library you know what to do now.",
  "meaningInfo": "Picture yourself sitting on a rocking chair in the library knitting away. It's quiet and peaceful and the light is warming you just right. Ahh, bliss!",
  "readingMnemonic": "You need to come to the library to <kanji>knit</kanji> because if you try to do it at home all your <reading>hen</reading>s (<ja>へん</ja>) will try to eat the thread. Hens love eating things that look like worms, like hay, string, and thread. So it's important to get far away from them before you start to knit.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine the granny or grampy you are (and must be to have hens and want to knit in peace in a library). You're tired of these hens eating your thread while you try to knit sweaters for all your grandbabies so you come to the library.",
