Nothing is too risky for <reading>Ken</reading> (<ja>けん</ja>) the samurai!\" The building is collapsing on the squid, the risk is so great, but Ken the samurai dives in and saves him!",
  "readingInfo": "The squid cries, \"I can build one that isn't so risky next time!\" Ken shakes his head, \"I'm not letting you do anymore risky things, you're coming with me from now on.\" Ken scoops up the squid into a bucket, hoists him over his shoulder, and walks off into the sunset.\n\nWho knows what adventures await our new duo. All we know is that they'll definitely be getting into some risky business.",
