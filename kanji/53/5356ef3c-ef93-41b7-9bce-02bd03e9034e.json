  "meaningInfo": "Imagine being in the haven of a brush while a tsunami strikes. Hear the water crash and rush all around you while you remain safe in your haven.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The only downside about this <kanji>haven</kanji> is that there’s only room for <reading>two</reading> (<ja>つ</ja>) people in the brush. The brush isn’t big enough for more than two people, so unless you have a lot of brush, you won’t be saving many people from the tsunami.",
  "readingInfo": "Since there is room for two people in the brush, imagine yourself in the haven with one other person. They and you make two. The other person is a real whiner though - imagine them crying the whole time.",
