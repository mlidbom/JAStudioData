  "readingMnemonic": "This symbol to <kanji>abstain</kanji> comes from the <reading>hica</reading>tee (<ja>ひか</ja>) turtle. The hicatee is a Central American river turtle hunted for its meat, eggs, and shell. Therefore, the poor hicatee is endangered. So people started to rally around it, abstaining from hurting them anymore. They raised their fingers to the sky and shouted, \"I abstain from harming this hicatee!\"",
  "readingInfo": "Picture yourself in Central America. Standing in the water, blocking poachers from the hicatee turtles. \"Abstain!\" you shout at them.",
