  "readingMnemonic": "You see a very <kanji>long</kanji> person. It's Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> (<ja>ちょう</ja>), who has made herself long, like her street. \"I made myself long so I can watch more of the street, my domain. I'm the <kanji>leader</kanji> of these streets. Watch yourself not-long person,\" says Mrs. Chou.",
  "readingInfo": "<kanji>Long</kanji> isn't an idea that's easy to imagine in any specific sense, but you can try some other things too, as long as it gets associated with Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading>. For the most part, when you see a kanji with the radical <ja>長</ja> the reading will be <ja>ちょう</ja>.",
