  "sourceMeaningMnemonic": "A <radical>tsunami</radical> is an <radical>alcohol</radical>ic beverage containing a lot of <kanji>alcohol</kanji>. It’s 3 different kinds of rums, pineapple juice, and grenadine. It’ll hit you like a tsunami though. This alcoholic drink has a kick to it.",
  "meaningInfo": "It’s made with spiced rum, coconut rum, and dark rum. Imagine yourself on a sandy beach drinking this cocktail. Feel the sun on your face and the wind in your hair as you sip on this fruity and rummy alcoholic beverage known as a tsunami. You could even picture an actual tsunami in the water coming right for you. I wouldn’t recommend it though—actual tsunami are scary, not drinkable and delicious.",
  "readingMnemonic": "As you lay on this beach, the <kanji>alcohol</kanji> keeps coming down a <reading>chu</reading>te (<ja>しゅ</ja>), straight into your mouth. You can feel the sand in your toes and the alcohol sliding down your throat from this special tsunami chute.",
  "readingInfo": "Picture the alcohol flowing down this long chute from somewhere far away. You try to see where it's coming from, but all you can see is this long, long chute stretching along the entire beach, until it disappears into the distance. You should probably be concerned that you're nonstop drinking alcohol from a random chute, but it tastes so good!",
