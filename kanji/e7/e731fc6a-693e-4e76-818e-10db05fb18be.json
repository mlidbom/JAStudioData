  "readingMnemonic": "Of course when you find a toe <kanji>above</kanji> the ground, you want to know where the toe came from. When you examine it, you see a name written on there. This toe belongs to the local clumsy farmhand, <reading>Jou</reading>rm (<ja>じょう</ja>).",
  "readingInfo": "Try to remember Jourm, the local farmhand. He is a recurring character that will come up anytime the reading for a kanji is <ja>じょう</ja>.\n\nHe is a very big man, and he wears farmer's clothes. It's important to imagine your version of Jourm as very big, because it will help us to differentiate him from Jo-Anne, who is the character associated with the similar, but shorter reading (and character) <ja>じょ</ja>. Although Jourm will develop as you go through all the <ja>じょう</ja> reading kanji, for now just imagine him as a big, kinda slow dude who works for a local farmer. Also, he only has nine or fewer toes, apparently.",
