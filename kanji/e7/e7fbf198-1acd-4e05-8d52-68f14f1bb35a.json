  "sourceMeaningMnemonic": "The <radical>elephant</radical> radical and the <kanji>elephant</kanji> kanji are the same. But! This kanji has another meaning: <kanji>phenomenon</kanji>. If you were the first person to see an elephant, you'd call it that too.",
  "meaningInfo": "Picture the first Japanese person to see an elephant. He stops dead in his tracks, points and screams out, \"What a phenomenon!\"",
  "readingMnemonic": "<kanji>Elephant</kanji>s are great and all, except that when they die they turn into elephant <reading>zo</reading>mbies (<ja>ぞう</ja>). But you never see these zombies because the <reading>shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>) has a special project in place that destroys all elephant bodies when they die.\n\nHint: The readings and meanings for this kanji match up really nicely. <ja>ぞう</ja> is always for elephant and <ja>しょう</ja> is always for phenomenon. Remember it like this, the elephant is the zombie and the shougun keeps everyone from finding out about this phenomenon.",
  "readingInfo": "Picture the shougun standing over a pit of zombie elephants. None of these are getting out on his watch, letting people believe in such crazy phenomenons.",
