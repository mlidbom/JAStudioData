The tsunami was pretty violent, and it looks like this axe got blown into some fish and cut off their fins and now those things are just on the ground by the beach.",
  "meaningInfo": "See these things on the beach. It makes sense to see fins, as fins are usually in the ocean, so seeing them on the beach is logical. Pick up the stuff you find as you feel the beach sand between your toes.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Walking down the <kanji>beach</kanji> a bit more, you also find a <reading>hammer</reading> (<ja>はま</ja>). Gosh, looks like the tsunami hit a workshop or a hardware store or something. First the axe, now a hammer.",
  "readingInfo": "Pick up the hammer in your hand. It’s pretty heavy. The tsunami must have been very strong to pick up such a heavy hammer.",
