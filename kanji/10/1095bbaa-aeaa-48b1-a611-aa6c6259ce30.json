  "sourceMeaningMnemonic": "When your <radical>tongue</radical> becomes too <radical>spicy</radical> for you to bear, it’s time to <kanji>quit</kanji> the jalapeño eating contest. You’ve been eating them for three hours now and the spiciness from the peppers is really burning your tongue. Throw in the towel, it’s time to quit the contest.\n\nThis kanji has another meaning too:\n\nEating isn't the only thing that makes your <radical>tongue</radical> <radical>spicy</radical>, so do certain <kanji>word</kanji>s. Say your favorite words out loud right now. Feel them on your tongue. Words are the spicy food of language!",
  "meaningInfo": "You may have to quit eating but you never have to quit saying words. Especially if you're, well, trying to learn a whole new language full of them.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Oh, you're probably wondering who won that spicy food contest after you <kanji>quit</kanji> and became obsessed with <kanji>word</kanji>s instead. It was <reading>Je</reading>sus (<ja>じ</ja>). Who did you expect? He was great with words AND never quitting when things got spicy.",
  "readingInfo": "Picture Jesus scarfing down jalapeño peppers. He never quits. And then he says some words about how the jalapeños gave up their lives for this contest, so we better appreciate them. Thanks Jesus!",
