Think back to a fake memory you have living on the farm. You have your gun, and you gotta use it on a cow (ruh roh). Once a <kanji>year</kanji> on New Year's, you have to go out and shoot one of the cows. It's only a yearly shooting, though, so at least there's that respite.",
  "meaningInfo": "You'll have to imagine yourself doing this to remember the meaning of the kanji. Focus on the thought that \"okay... it's only once a year... I only have to do this once a <kanji>year</kanji>...\"",
  "readingMnemonic": "It is New <kanji>Years</kanji>, though, so when you bring the dead cow back home, it’s time to celebrate. Using the cow’s organs and bones, you and your siblings construct a <reading>nen</reading>doroid (<ja>ねん</ja>). Nendoroids are Japanese toys - little plastic figurines (Google it if need be). You make a little cow nendoroid holding a gun. How cute.",
  "readingInfo": "How funny that you use dead cow parts to make a miniature cow holding a gun much like the one you murdered earlier. Imagine yourself playing with this nendoroid as you think about how weird it was to make a cow nendoroid out of a dead cow.",
