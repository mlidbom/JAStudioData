Then, it starts to become more and more clear, and you start saying \"that can't be <reading>me</reading>. No way it's me...\" When the person comes up to you (the person, being you) you learn about parallel universes and other fabulous things. Still, the whole time you can't stop thinking about how \"this person looks just like me... no, this person is me!\"",
