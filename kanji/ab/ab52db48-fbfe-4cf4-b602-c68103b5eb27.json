He died up there so the rest of them wouldn't have to. Because they definitely aren't getting caught now, if the penalty is a burning death in the new sun prison.",

  "readingInfo": "Really, it's not the fault of the people who put him there that he's become a martyr. It's the month of June. PUNISH JUNE! PUT JUNE IN THE SUN PRISON! (Is what I assume those yakuza are shouting.)",
