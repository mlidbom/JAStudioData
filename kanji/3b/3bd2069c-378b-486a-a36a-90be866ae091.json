  "meaningInfo": "It's kind of weird that the flowers radical is only a part of the flower kanji, but you'll make do. Just focus on the fact that the leader is planting all these flowers for a bigger picture thing (that's what leaders do). He wants there to be flowers for future generations as well, because he's a nice dude like that.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The leader can't stop planting <kanji>flower</kanji>s though. He's going crazy. Maybe it's the pollen? He comes up to someone named <reading>Hannah</reading> (<ja>はな</ja>) and starts planting flowers in her face, probably killing her in the process.",
