The methodic thump thump thumping of a heart puts me in a trance that gives me great ideas. It’s a very inspirational sound, the sound of a heart is. It gives me an idea. \n\nAlternatively, you could look at this kanji and see a \"stand\" radical and something that kind of (almost) looks like the kanji for \"think.\" When you stand up and think, you come up with your very own <kanji>idea</kanji>s!",
  "meaningInfo": "Put your hand over your heart, or on your wrist, or somewhere you can feel your pulse. Your heart is pumping blood through your body, hear the sound of your heart beat and try to picture and get an idea for how all the blood flows through your body.",

The person who knew this probably came up with the <kanji>idea</kanji> to make the bald eagle a symbol of the United States. Eagles are always flying around and doing things, so their hearts are very strong.",
  "readingInfo": "Picture the majestic animal that is the bald eagle. Imagine the sound of an eagle screeching as it zooms through the air, flapping its wings in the wind. It’s pretty impressive.",
