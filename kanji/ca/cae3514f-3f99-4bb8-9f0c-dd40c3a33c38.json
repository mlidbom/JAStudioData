He hates swords, and will only use fists because it's the honorable way to fight, so he starts helping you detain them!\n\nHe's also found a <reading>loo</reading>phole (<ja>る</ja>) in the system and you don't have to be super gentle with these guys either. So detain them as forcefully as you want. It is your rice paddy they're in, after all.",
