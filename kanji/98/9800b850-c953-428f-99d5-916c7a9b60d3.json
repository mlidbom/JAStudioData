Setting his house on fire isn’t exactly the brightest idea, but the gambler is taking a gamble that the things he baked and cooked in the fire will offset the cost of a new home. \n\nThis kanji also means <kanji>burn</kanji>, because when you cook or bake something for too long, that's exactly what it does.",
