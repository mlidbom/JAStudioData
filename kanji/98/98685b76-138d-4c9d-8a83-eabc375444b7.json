They link their triceratops horns together and form an unbreakable gold chain. You can't eat them, because they're gold. So they're only really good for their chaining together ability.",
  "meaningInfo": "Picture these little gold triceratops shellfish linked together by their horns in a chain around your neck. Feel them hanging there. Sparkly and cold.",
  "readingMnemonic": "However, the only way to break the <kanji>chain</kanji> is to <reading>saw</reading> (<ja>さ</ja>) it open. Once the triceratops shellfish start holding on, they never let go. So when you want to take the chain off you have to really hack at it with your saw.",
  "readingInfo": "Picture the saw in your hands, sawing back and forth on the gold chain around your neck. Maybe this isn't the best fashion accessory if you have to use a saw to get it off.",
