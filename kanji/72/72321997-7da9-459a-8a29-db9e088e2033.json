There's like, no trace of them at all. Your parents can't even remember if you were born with fingers or not. Jets are that powerful.",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine your fingers slowly getting closer and closer to the jet's engine. It feels like it's going to suck your whole body in. And you better watch out, because if it does you'll be erased from the planet. And probably from time itself.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You're almost done <kanji>eras</kanji>ing your fingers when the jet starts sucking all of you in. You would try to grab the closest thing to you, but your fingers don't exist anymore, so you hold onto the <reading>mats</reading> (<ja>まつ</ja>) at your feet with your toes. The mats are super strong (they're made for jets, after all) and you manage to save yourself!",
  "readingInfo": "Now you're so thankful to the mats. If they weren't there you might have erased your whole body! Thank you mats! I'll never walk on you without thanking you for your service again!",
