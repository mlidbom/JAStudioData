Someone stuck a flag into some sort of animal, pushing it under the ground. All that’s visible now is some fur and part of the tail.",
  "meaningInfo": "What kind of animal could it be? You start to feel the soft fur with your hand and then the stench of death hits your nostrils. Ew.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You try to pull the flag out of the ground and hear a rumbling buzzing sound. At the end of the flagpole you see a huge <reading>bee</reading>hive (<ja>び</ja>)! These bees made their home under the <kanji>tail</kanji>! Maybe that’s why the flag was sticking in it… to warn people. Oops.",
  "readingInfo": "See the bees swarming out from around the tail and toward your face. Run! Run before there’s nothing left of you but your own tail!",
