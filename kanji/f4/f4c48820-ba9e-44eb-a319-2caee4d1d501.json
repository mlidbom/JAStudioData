  "readingInfo": "Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> is a character you'll see a lot throughout WaniKani, anytime the reading is <ja>ちょう</ja> like this one. A lore will develop around her, so the more vividly you can imagine your Mrs. Chou right now, the easier things will get later. In general, she's a mean, evil woman, so as long as you imagine her within those parameters, you're good. And, when I say she is a \"street-woman\" in the mnemonic, I don't mean she is homeless. She has a nice, middle-class home that's not outside of her financial means. What I'm saying is she wanders the streets looking for evil things to do. These are HER streets. So whenever you see the street radical, know that Mrs. Chou is probably going to show up!",
