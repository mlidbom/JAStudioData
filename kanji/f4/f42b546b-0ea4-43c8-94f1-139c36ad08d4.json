You'd think they'd fight, but they took their battle to another venue... they're competing in a game show! One of them answers a question, and the host says, \"<kanji>Success</kanji>! You're <kanji>correct</kanji>!\"",
  "meaningInfo": "Feel free to think through several questions and answers, but make sure they're all right, because that's what we're focusing on. Also make sure to focus on the triceratops and the wolverine themselves. You want to make sure that when you see these two radicals you automatically know they're playing in a game show, not doing anything else, like fighting or racing or something.",
  "readingMnemonic": "When we need to remember the reading <ja>とう</ja>, we use the Japanese city Tokyo. The last question in the game show match is the following: \"What is the capital of Japan.\" The triceratops and the wolverine scream the <kanji>correct</kanji> answer at the same time: <ja><reading>とう</reading>きょう</ja>!",
  "readingInfo": "Wow, that was a pretty easy answer to get right. <ja>とうきょう</ja> is what pretty much everyone would guess, and they'd be correct.",
