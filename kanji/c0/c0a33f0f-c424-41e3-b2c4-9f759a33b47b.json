This is your dreamland. You always dream about tsunamis and the turkeys carrying crosses that ride them. This might be strange for other people, but for you it’s pretty normal.",

You don’t know why June is the only time you have dreams about tsunami riding turkeys, but that’s just the way it is.",
  "readingInfo": "It’s usually pretty toasty in the month of June (in the Northern Hemisphere, at least) so imagine going to bed in this heat. Feel the spray of the refreshing tsunami water in your dream as the turkey continues to ride those tsunami waves with his cross.",
