The heart needs to be purified so that’s why you have it on the cross and your friend lives on a rice paddy farm so that’s why you’re running through that. The favor you are paying your friend back with is getting him this heart. He needs a new one and you’re providing it.",

  "readingMnemonic": "You arrive at your friend’s place and you can finally return the <kanji>favor</kanji> you owe him by presenting him with the heart. “<reading>Eh</reading> (<ja>え</ja>)? What’s this? I didn’t ask for this!” “Eh!?!?” you reply. Apparently he didn’t want a real heart, he wanted a candy one. He wanted a Valentine!",
