  "sourceMeaningMnemonic": "A <radical>drunkard</radical> is the kind of <radical>person</radical> who would <radical>poop</radical> two times under a <radical>tree</radical> before using a <kanji>machine</kanji> toilet. There’s a perfectly good outhouse with a machine toilet right there, but this drunkard is so drunk that he decides to poop under the tree instead. And not only does he poop once, he poops twice.",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine this drunkard, squatting down under the tree to poop. You can smell the poop and a faint stench of alcohol in the air. How could he not have realized that there was a portable machine toilet right there?",
  "readingMnemonic": "Oh, I see – the door to the outhouse with the machine toilet is locked, and the drunkard doesn’t have the <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>). If he had a <kanji>machine</kanji> like a jackhammer, or a circular saw, or some other heavy duty machine, he might be able to get in without a key, but since he has none of those or a key, he’s reduced to pooping under the tree instead.",
  "readingInfo": "Listen to the drunkard grumbling about the lack of a key as he poops under the tree. He doesn’t sound happy, and every time he stresses to push out the poop, his voice fluctuates. Imagine hearing this in your mind and being a wee bit disgusted.",
