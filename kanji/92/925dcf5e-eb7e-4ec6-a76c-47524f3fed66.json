  "meaningInfo": "The cape covering the mouth represents how this bureau never talks about their secrets. The flag represents your country. Think about all the cool secret things the Bureau of Secret Things must have.",

  "readingInfo": "Now, this mnemonic isn’t perfectly close, but the goal is to get you close enough in your brain so that you can remember <ja>きょく</ja> later. If you can get to CLOAK YOU, then you can get to <ja>きょく</ja> much easier than just trying to get there from scratch. So imagine working in this bureau and getting to cloak yourself all the time.",
