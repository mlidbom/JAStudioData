  "meaningInfo": "Imagine this happening in front of you. See the tsunami turn from the color of water to the color of a forest. The dye washes over you and now you’re forest green as well.",
  "readingMnemonic": "The <kanji>dye</kanji> continues to pass through the forest and hits a group of <reading>cen</reading>taurs (<ja>せん</ja>). Now each centaur is dyed with the forest green dye. They don’t look happy.",
  "readingInfo": "Hear each centaur shouting about how he hates that dye for changing his color. They look kind of funny, so you laugh at them a bit, but not too loud – they might hear you and get even more angry.",
