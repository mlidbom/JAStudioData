  "sourceMeaningMnemonic": "You have to take the measurement of a leader. Imagine yourself measuring that leader's height and then coming up short. This is not good, you think. Leaders need to be at least six feet tall. So, to make the leader tall enough, you <kanji>attach</kanji> another head to the top of the leader's head.",
  "meaningInfo": "Make sure you really feel like the person can’t be a leader because they’re too short when you measure them (I know this isn’t true, but we’re remembering kanji here, anything goes!). As long as you feel disconcerted that the leader isn’t tall enough, you should be able to remember that you need to attach something to the leader to make them tall enough. The fact that you’re attaching another head to the top of the leader's head is pretty weird too, and should help you to remember the meaning.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You have to remember the kun'yomi reading of this kanji, and the part you need to remember is <ja>つ</ja>. So, think of <kanji>attach</kanji>ing something to something else. What would you need? You'd need <reading>two</reading> (<ja>つ</ja>) things to put together!",
