  "sourceMeaningMnemonic": "If you trap the <radical>moon</radical> in a <radical>greenhouse</radical> it will grow a creepy <kanji>membrane</kanji> around itself. The moon isn't used to the heat it would be exposed to in a greenhouse so that membrane is there to protect it. It's really gross looking though.",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine seeing the moon with a membrane sitting stuffed in a greenhouse. It looks like something out of the Alien movies and you're starting to think putting it in there wasn't a good idea.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You decide to open the greenhouse to check this moon <kanji>membrane</kanji> out but when you open the door the smell of big <reading>mac</reading>s (<ja>まく</ja>) hits you in the face. Eww. Why does this membrane smell like a big mac... or does that mean big macs smell like a festering moon?",
  "readingInfo": "Can you imagine if the moon had a membrane and it smelled like a big mac? How does that even happen? You should probably go ask that food chain what they use for their ingredients.",
