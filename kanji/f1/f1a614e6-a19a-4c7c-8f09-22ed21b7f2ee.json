  "readingMnemonic": "\"Wow, your <kanji>shoulder</kanji> is just like my <reading>cata</reading>pult (<ja>かた</ja>)!\" you hear someone shout. As you turn you're just in time to see a man catapulting through his own moon door!",
  "readingInfo": "Now the weird man is inspecting your shoulder really closely and he keeps muttering \"catapult powers\" under his breath. It's very unsettling, but he's kind of right. A shoulder works just like the mechanism that winds up a catapult.",
