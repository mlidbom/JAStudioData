  "meaningInfo": "To help this mnemonic along, literally imagine your older brother as someone that's just a giant mouth with a pair of legs walking around. It talks and talks and talks, too, irritating you. Feel the irritation specifically at your older brother. He's older than you, so you can't beat him up... yet.",
