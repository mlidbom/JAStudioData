The umbrella is big enough to be a hat for all four people, so it makes sense. All four of them are religious missionaries, so that’s why they’re holding the cross.",
  "meaningInfo": "See these four people all under one umbrella. No one is carrying the umbrella, it’s just resting on all of their heads like a hat. Their hands are busy holding that cross, anyway.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You know the Spanish phrase “Mi <reading>casa</reading> (<ja>かさ</ja>) es su casa”? Well this is kind of like that, but only with a hat. And that hat is an <kanji>umbrella</kanji>. Mi casa es yours too, because it’s an umbrella and also a hat. This makes sense, trust me.",
  "readingInfo": "Imagine the four people in the umbrella hat again, only this time imagine them skipping along singing “Mi casa es su casa”. It’ll help you remember.",
