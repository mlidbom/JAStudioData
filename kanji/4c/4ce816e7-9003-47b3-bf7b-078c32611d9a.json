People think memories are kept in your brain, but that's not true. Your heart is where all of your most precious memories are kept, and when it dies, you forget them all.",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine someone close to you experiencing the death of their heart. They look right at you but they've already started to forget everything. I know this is not a fun thing to imagine, but use that emotion to help you remember this kanji, not forget it.",
  "readingMnemonic": "When someone <kanji>forget</kanji>s everything they're left with only one thing to do: go <reading>bow</reading>ling (<ja>ぼう</ja>). Bowling is easy, and there's nothing to forget. You pick up a ball. You drop it. Everything else is automatically taken care of.",
  "readingInfo": "You know, that's probably why so many old people go bowling. They forgot everything else.",
