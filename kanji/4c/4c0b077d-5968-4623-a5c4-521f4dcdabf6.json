There’s an arrow in this turkey. The arrow looks a little broken, so there’s probably splinters all up inside that turkey. I know you’re all hungry but I can’t recommend eating this bird.",
  "meaningInfo": "You can’t recommend this turkey. It’s probably dangerous. Imagine sending this turkey back in a restaurant, very upset with everything. Also keep in mind that the arrow is half buried in the turkey and looks a little broken since the arrow radical is a bit off.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You <kanji>recommend</kanji> the Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>) special instead of this arrow-tainted turkey! When it comes out, your heart sinks. Genghis Khan apparently ate a cow with an arrow broken off in it.",
  "readingInfo": "Welp, I guess if Genghis Khan recommends eating food with weapons still in them, you're okay with recommending it too. Eat up, everyone.",
