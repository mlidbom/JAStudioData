  "meaningInfo": "Imagine slowly sewing your scooter to the signpost, passing the thread back and forth through the signpost's metal holes and your scooter's handles.",
  "readingMnemonic": "You usually only <kanji>sew</kanji> at <reading>ho</reading>me (<ja>ほう</ja>), so this is a big exception for you. You're usually worried that if you sew in public people will judge your stitches, so this is a big step for you!",
  "readingInfo": "Hopefully, if your scooter is still here later you'll be able to start sewing outside of your home more often from now on!",
