  "sourceMeaningMnemonic": "There is a <radical>moon</radical> and a <radical>city</radical> inside your <kanji>lung</kanji>. Inside of your lung there is a city and above that city lies a moon. It’s a pretty sight, but also very strange. Moons and cities don’t usually reside inside lungs.",
  "meaningInfo": "Imagine having a moon and a city inside your lung. Feel their presence as you breathe in and breathe out. Also, <ja>月</ja> often refers to internal organs as well, so remember that when you see this kanji.",
  "readingMnemonic": "Having a moon and city inside your <kanji>lung</kanji> inspires you to write a <reading>hai</reading>ku (<ja>はい</ja>). Perhaps the city and moon are just metaphorical. Either way, a haiku is the best way to go about things here.",
  "readingInfo": "The city and moon\nInside my lung, forgotten.\nWhere is the answer?\n\nOr just think of your own haiku. Be creative!",
